Personal Currency is an concept from The Makers Collective, which I learned during their Side-Hustle 101 Course in 2020. 

The idea of currencies is that everyone has things that are important to them that they **want**. These are related to values, but they're not values themselves. They can be considered when drafting [[02. Notes/Notes/Drafting a Purpose Statement\|Purpose Statements]] and [[02. Notes/Notes/Vision Statement\|Vision Statements]] or plans. 

Currencies are similar to [[02. Notes/Notes/Drafting a Purpose Statement#^d57050\|True Rewards]] from the audio course [[04. Sources/@whelanFindingYourPurpose2021\|Finding Your Purpose]]. They are the things we seek that intrinsically motivate us towards our purpose. They are unique to each of us, but they are ultimately the things we seek that drive us to do things.
