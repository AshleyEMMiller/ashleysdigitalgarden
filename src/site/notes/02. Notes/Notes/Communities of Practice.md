# Background
## What is a community of practice

Community of Practice was first coined by Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger, who specialized in cognitive anthropology. Through their study of apprenticeships, they developed a theory that a "community can act as a living curriculum". The intent of a community of practice is to build out a shared body of knowledge through regular interactions. 

Three things make up a community of practice:
1. Domain
	1. A shared topic/field of interest, passion or concern
	2. Emphasis is on collective learning where each individual contributes and shares their knowledge. 
2. Community
	1. Members need to actively create a sense of community around the topic of interest 
	2. Community building activities include: face-to-face and online meetings, webinars, discussion forums, group activities, 
3. Practice
	1. Members actively work towards the shared goal of learning how to do things better and increase their knowledge
	2. Members actively work together to create resources and share ideas
	3. There is a philosophy of continuous improvement

# How to create, build and maintain a community of practice. 

1. **Identify the purpose and scope of the community of practice**: Determine the specific purpose or topic for your community of practice. This could be a particular area of expertise, a shared interest, or a common goal. Clearly outline the boundaries, goals, and objectives of your community of practice. This will help members understand what to expect and what is expected of them.

2. **Recruit members with relevant knowledge and interests**: Set clear criteria for membership, ensuring that members are active practitioners who can contribute relevant and valuable experiences. Reach out to individuals who have relevant knowledge, experience, or interest in the identified topic. You can invite them personally, use existing networks, or promote the community through relevant channels. Having participants from multiple career levels can facilitate an apprenticeship model and dialogue. 

3. **Establish communication channels for interaction and systems of governance**: Set up communication channels that facilitate interaction and knowledge sharing among members. This can include online platforms, forums, mailing lists, or regular meetings.

4. **Facilitate sharing of resources and knowledge with member**s: Encourage members to share their expertise, resources, and experiences with each other. This can be through synchronous (e.g. discussions, presentations, workshops, or collaborative projects) or asynchronous channels. One of the benefits of a Community of Practice is the possibility of learning through peripheral participation (e.g. an email newsletter with resources)

5. **Foster a supportive, welcoming and productive environment**: Create a safe and inclusive space where members feel comfortable sharing and learning from one another. Encourage respectful and constructive interactions, and address any conflicts or issues that may arise. Pay attention to the well-being of the community members. Act as a facilitator and ensure that ground rules are set to encourage positive and constructive information sharing. 

6. **Facilitate engagement and active participation of the members**: Act as a facilitator or moderator to stimulate discussions, ask questions, and guide conversations. Encourage active participation and ensure that all members have a voice.  Encourage and facilitate interactions between members on a personal level. 

7. **Provide learning opportunities**: Organize learning activities such as webinars, workshops, or guest speaker sessions to enhance the knowledge and skills of community members. 

8. **Evaluate and iterate; make adjustments as needed**: Regularly assess the effectiveness and impact of your community of practice. Seek feedback from members and make necessary adjustments to improve its value and relevance.

9. **Sustain and grow**: Continuously nurture and support the community to ensure its long-term sustainability. Encourage member contributions, recognize their efforts, and explore opportunities for collaboration and expansion.
