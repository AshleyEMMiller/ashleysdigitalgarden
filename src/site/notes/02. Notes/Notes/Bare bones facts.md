If we extend the metaphor of [[02. Notes/Notes/Bare bones facts\|Bare Bones Facts]] to its logical conclusion, let's take for example the problem with paleontology and reconstructing dinosaurs. If you only have the bones, what does that truly tell you about how an animal moves and looks? What about the flesh, the skin, the feathers and spots? So much is absent from "bones" and why they give the skeleton or structure, in a very gross and macro sense, that is not all a living thing is. The same is true of ideas and information. When it is just the "bare bones," then what are you missing out on?
