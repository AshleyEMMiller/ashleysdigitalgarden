>[!summary] Abstract
> Meaning-making is the process where information and experiences gain personal significance to the recipient. Mere exposure to information is not enough to make it meaningful, it's through contextual, active connections that new things become meaningful. Can we then argue that improving public understanding of science extends beyond ensuring people can recall accurate information but that information has meaning and therefore they have a greater depth of knowing.

A few years ago, I got a friend of mine onto [[Bullet Journal\|Bullet Journalling]] and, like me, she found the practice highly useful. Recently, I've been diagnosed with ADHD (sort of). I'd told this friend, and she's been listening to me make realizations and observations of my jerry-rigged compensations or self-accommodations for the past few months. After a chat she, Discord messaged me to mention that the creator of the Bullet Journal, Ryder Carrol, developed the system to help him get through life with his ADHD. I responded, 
> "Yeah. I did but when I first found out it didn’t really mean anything to me at the time."

[[02. Notes/Notes/Meaning-making\|Meaning-making]] is the interpretation people give to their information, objects and experiences that make them personally significant. [^1][^2]  If learning is a process of meaning-making it means (lol) we must acknowledge that identities and experiences shape the learning experience. [^1] Meaning-making is an active, continuous, and highly contextual process of assigning significance to life's events and new information. [^3]

When we think of science culture and science learning, how do we apply the concept of meaning-making? While [[sense-making\|sense-making]] is often used in the context of science subject matter, meaning-making is about personal connection to science. From a learning theory perspective, this is the "existential level" of meaning-making. The personal meaning, while informed by social context, is more relevant to the individual's life and path. [^4]

Something is meaningful when it cannot be described in pure physical qualities[^5][^6]. It takes on an abstract quality that is more than the sum of its parts. This definition more readily applies to communication and the social aspects of meaning (intention and correctness of meaning). However, with science concepts that are explorations and explanations of the physical world, meaning-making as a personal process and experience is about the personal. It's about forging connections between content and lived experiences, intertwining it into their body of knowledge and making it stick[^7]. 

If we return to my earlier story about the fact that Ryder Carroll's ADHD inspired him to develop the [[Bullet Journal\|Bullet Journal]] method. If you asked me a year ago, I would have said, yes, I knew that. Did I care? Not really. It wasn't meaningful. Now? That fact is intertwined with a very personal connection, and it influences the way I reread his work. I'm approaching it through this newfound lens of meaning: I also have ADHD, and so I'm paying closer attention. I'm looking for more connections. I'm learning about what means the most to me.
