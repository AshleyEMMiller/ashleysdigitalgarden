In the Vox video [[04. Sources/Why everything you buy is worse now\|Why everything you buy is worse now]], the presenters cite the cost of a bra as being $30 ten years ago and the cost of manufacturing has increased so that if manufacturing costs were not overemphasized it might cost $50.00. And people don't want to spend more than $30 even though it was $30 ten years ago and labour costs have changed.[^1]

Post-puberty I have always had a large bust. I don't know if I've spent less that $50 for a bra since I moved from training bras. I would say in the last decade, I have paid $80.00 to $100.00 (pre-tax) for bras. It used to be a Boxing Day purchase. I would get some money for Christmas and go get some new bras. It used to be from Sears and after they shut down I went to plus sized retailers since only departments stores actually sold a variety of sizes. I may not be willing to pay more than $100 for a bra, but who can afford to pay more than $100 on a bra. Bras are probably the single most expensive item of clothing I buy. I've bought fancy dresses occasionally than were over $100. But I've probably done that maybe 4 times in my whole life, not including my prom dress (which was handmade by a seamstress). 

It's not just that people don't want to pay more for clothing, it's that for certain items people really *can't* pay more. If I need three new bras that's $300 for three pieces of flimsy fabric, straps and eye hooks. 

The only other thing I consistently pay a lot for, almost every year or so, are running shoes, which I will replace recularly and just have to accept.

I think this is the frustrating bit. I would argue that bras are essential. I cannot comfortably live my life outside of my home without one. Sports bras doubly so. We are told we must exercise to stay healthy and when you have a G cup exercise is not happening without a good fitting sports bra. I **cannot** run without proper running shoes. I **cannot** leave my house or exercise without a well-fitting appropriate bra. These are not about fashion trends. There are essentials.

[^1]: Frankly I disagree with this argument based on the 2022 Harvard Business Review report on increased markup from 2016-2019 ([[02. Notes/Excalidraw/Since 2006-2019 retailers have make 30 percent profit on mark up.excalidraw 1\|Since 2006-2019 retailers have make 30 percent profit on mark up.excalidraw 1]]) and price increases and 2023 reports indicating that corporate profits were driving inflation more usual.
