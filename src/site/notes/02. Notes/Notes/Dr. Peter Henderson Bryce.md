Cindy Blackstock (Gitxsan First Nation) is the Executive Director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada. She is primarily responsible for elevating Dr. Bryce's legacy as an Indigenous Ally who spoke out against [[Residential Schools\|Residential Schools]] in the early 1900s. [^1]

Dr. Bryce is currently buried in Beechwood Cemetary in Ottawa, Ontario. It is memorialized with a garden and plaque and is maintained by Blackstock [1]. 

In 1904, he was recruited by the Canadian government to understand the death rate among Indigenous children at residential schools. in 1907, he reported his findings: the health conditions of residential schools led to the 24% to 69% mortality rate of the children, and the federal government's negligence was to blame. While he believed his report would lead to reform, he was dismissed instead, and his funding was withdrawn. He was barred from presenting at academic conferences and was pushed from public service[^1]. 

His findings were leaked to the front page of the Ottawa newspaper at the time, and nothing came of it. Emphasizing that people knew about what was happening with the residential schools for some time. [^2]
