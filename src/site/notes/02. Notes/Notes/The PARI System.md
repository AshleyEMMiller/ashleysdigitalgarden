The PARI framework practically applies [[02. Notes/Notes/Mindframing\|Mindframing]], coined and developed by Anne-Laure Le Cunff (of Ness Labs). 

The emphasis of PARI is to create a productivity system that works for them through mindfulness and intentional, iterative output. Instead of churning things out, PARI fosters [[Growth Loops\|Growth Loops]]. [^Le Cunff, 2019]

Le Cunff cites the following James Clear quote about the importance of systems.

But follows it up with the reminder that without goals, we're just moving without a direction, or a milestone. Goals and systems work in an ecosystem of productivity that, with mindfulness and strategic and purposeful planning, can create a cycle of growth and personal development. PARI emphasizes the importance of long-term goals through continuous activity. 

## The Steps of PARI
There are four steps: Pact, Act, React, and Impact
### [[02. Notes/Notes/PACT Goals\|PACT]]
Begin by making a commitment to generating a level of output. While broader impact is important at this stage so you know what your long-term objectives are, this step is not about outcomes. **Commit to repetitions of a small easily-repeatable action.** Flexibility is key. 
### Act
Time to do the thing. The best way to ensure this happens is to block time in your calendar. Not only does it hold your feet to the fire, but it helps to build a habit. 
### React
Build in systems for regular reflection, assessment and adjustment of your commitment and actions. Reflection also helps you consolidate learning.

In the PARI system, **this step is meant to be public**. In alignment with the ideas of [[Show your work\|Show your work]] and [[Learning in public\|Learning in public]]. The method nor medium don't matter what matters is that you put things out there in the hopes of getting feedback. 

This has the added benefit of recording and documenting your progress and labour. This is terrifying, but worth the effort. 
### Impact
This is the stage where you take on a big project as a way of applying your small lessons and pushing yourself. This was the guilding star for the Pact and Act phases. 

The aim is to select a project that you feel uncomfortable with and that you might not feel completely ready for. 

## The Benefits of PARI
The benefit of PARI is that while the Impact (or big project) is in the back of your mind, it's not what you're aiming for. It's not the "goal". This is helpful because we may not know how long it will take us to reach an objective, because life happens.

But we CAN commit to little steps regularly and when we've done enough iterations we can commit to an Impact project.
