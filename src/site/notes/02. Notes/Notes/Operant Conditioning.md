# ABCs of Behaviour
## Antecedent - Behaviour - Consequence
### Antecedent
- An observable event that happens before the behaviour occurs
### Behaviour
- Anything an individual does that can be "observed"
	- Overt: 
		- Can be observed from the outside (e.g. actions)
	- Covert:
		- Only observed by the individual performing the behaviour (e.g. thoughts)
### Consequence
- An observable event that happens after the behaviour occurs
## Law of Effect
- Behaviour is a function of its consequences
	- The probability of a behaviour happening is influenced by the past **consequences** of that behaviour
## Habits
- Habits are behaviours that are independent of the consequence and are initiated by the **antecedent**
# Reinforcement - Strengthening a behaviour
A reinforcer is anything that, in response to a behaviour (from the learner's perspective), increases or maintains the frequency of the behaviour
## Paul Chance's Rules for Reinforcement
1. Define the target behaviour
2. Select an appropriate reinforcer
	- What is reinforcing will vary by learners
	- Adding a reinforcer may be the first thing to reach for
	- Take advantage of natural reinforcers (e.g. environmental reinforcers)
1. Reinforcement must be immediate and certain
	1. In the case of dog training, this is the important of [[Marker Training\|Marker Training]]. The marker can be immediate even if the reinforcer itself cannot be.
2. Monitor results
## Problems with reinforcement 
### Inappropriate use
- Reinforcing an undesired behaviour 
- Reinforcing behaviour indiscriminately 
### Bootleg reinforcement 
- Reinforcement that is not a part of, and tends to undermine, an intervention
	- owner who has friends that encourage jumping up
	- leaving food on counter reinforces counter surfing
### Moral objections 
- Using R+ to manipulate the behaviour of someone outside of a training context
	- The dog should do this because he loves me! 
- Aversive control over behaviour vs appetitive control 
- Societal belief that you get what you deserve → eg. dog doesn’t come on the first recall, should be punished
### Interruption of normal social behaviour
- Sometimes can reinforce very unnatural behaviour 
### Unfulfilled expectations 
- Behaviour decreases when reinforcers are abruptly removed 
### Superstitious behaviours may evolve
- A harmless but unplanned behaviour may occur as part of your target behaviour 
### Reinforcing a strongly desired activity may backfire and build obsessions
- Ie. fetch and food 
### Addiction (?)
- Do learners become addicted to behaviour patterns because they were reinforced?

# Punishment
A punisher is a consequence that decreases the likelihood of the behaviour happening. It is important to frame punishment in the context of the behaviour not the individual . Do not conflate punishment with retribution. 

>[!important] Use LIMA (Least Invasive, Minimally Aversive) as a guideline
>- Use the mildest form of punishment that is effective
>- Use punishment dispassionately
>- If you punish from an emotional place you will fuck up
## Positive Punishment
The addition of something that decreases the occurrence of a behaviour.
## Negative Punishment
The removal of something that decreases the occurrence of a behaviour. Negative punishment is not "safer" than P+. In fact, in certain situations,  P- can be as traumatizing as P+.
## Various Rules
### Paul Chance's Rules for Punishment
1. Define the target behaviours
	- You must not just punish unwanted behaviour but reinforce desirable behaviour. What is the learner supposed to do besides the undesirable behaviour? Keep both in mind.
1. Select appropriate punishers
2. Make punishment immediate and certain
3. Use Extinction and Differential Reinforcement (of the desirable behaviour)
4. Monitor Results

1. The punishment must be something the animal dislikes AND something the animal does not expect
2. The punishment must suppress behaviour (this is, in fact, the very definition of something that is a punisher). If something is being used for punishment, but it does not suppress behaviour, it’s ineffective and often just plain abuse
3. The punishment must be of the perfect intensity. Too much and there will be negative fallout. You’ll end up hurting your relationship with the animal and losing more than just that behaviour. Too little and the punishment will only serve to desensitize the animal and build resistance
4. The punishment must happen immediately after the behaviour it is to be associated with. Otherwise, a clear enough association between the wrong behaviour and the punishment will not be made
5. The punishment must be associated with the behaviour, not with the trainer. Otherwise, the trainer becomes part of the punishment and the animal starts fearing and disliking the trainer
6. The punishment must happen every time the behaviour occurs. If punishment does not happen every time the behaviour occurs, the behaviour gets put on a variable schedule of reinforcement. Depending on the behaviour and how often the punishment actually occurs, the animal could decide that performing the behaviour was worth the risk of getting punished
7. There must be an alternative for the animal
8. Punishment must never be used to the extent that punishment outweighs positive reinforcement (from the animal’s perspective, not yours!)

### Ian Dunbar’s Eight Rules for Punishment

1. Punishment has to be effective
2. Punishment has to be immediate
3. Punishment has to be instructive
4. Punishment must be appropriate 
5. Punishment should only be delivered when appropriate behaviour is known
6. Punishment should only follow a warning. Dogs should be given the opportunity to avoid the punishment 
7. Rewards are always preferred. It is much easier to reward the one ‘right’ behaviour, than punish a bunch of less desirable behaviours
8. Punishments must be consistent. A punishment must occur each and every time the dog misbehaves, as inconsistent punishments act as random negative reinforcers (a strong form of reinforcement)

### Further reflection from Dunbar
Consider the following regarding positive punishment:
- Does it reduce the behaviour’s frequency?
- Is it painful or scary?

From here, four possible scenarios:
- Punishment that is painful or scary, and changes behaviour, is effective but undesirable
- Punishment that is painful or scary but doesn’t change behaviour is abusive
- Punishment that is not painful or scary and doesn’t change behaviour is nagging. It’s annoying, a nuisance
- Punishment that is not painful and not scary, but is effective, is desirable. (This is where Ian Dunbar chooses to work.)

>[!warning] Punishment should work the first time and beyond three repetitions is abusive

## Problems with punishment: 
- [[Humane hierarchy\|Humane hierarchy]] would have us use this last 
- Delaying punishment may create a situation where the delay itself is a reinforcer 
- Using too weak of a punisher may result in the tolerance of the aversive (habituation) and it comes off as nagging
	- If punishment isn’t working, we escalate (which may again lead to habituation)
- Using too strong a punisher for the individual may be abusive
- Non-contingent punishers will create distress (if the dog cannot tell why the punisher is happening)
- When punishment works, it is very reinforcing to the trainer
	- control is highly **highly** reinforcing and having control over our dogs behaviour can become reinforcing to us as the handlers.
- Moral objections: many people object to the use of any aversive on moral grounds, believing a number of things about their application
	- Paul Chance asks us ‘What is the alternative?’
		- If a dog is jumping the fence, and will run out into the road, then is a hot wire the wrong choice? 
		- If a dog is killing chickens, is a shock collar the wrong choice?

### Undesired side effects:
- Relationship damage between trainer and learner
- Development of conditioned punishers 
- Unexpected classical associations if the punishment is not administered in a controlled environment
- Defensive aggression
- Abuse if done incorrectly (i.e. it's not a punisher (by reducing the behaviour), it's just unpleasant for the dog)
- Imitation → other students in class may imitate instructors using punishment
- Learned helplessness - the dog may not feel like they can make the right choice at all, and so they just give up on trying anything
