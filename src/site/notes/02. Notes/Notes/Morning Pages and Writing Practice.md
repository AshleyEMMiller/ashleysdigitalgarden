# Natalie Goldbloom's Idea of Writing Practice

Natalie Goldbloom's writing practice was a developed from her relationship with her Zen teacher and he suggested that she use writing as her Zen practice. Her practice involved free writing for 15-30 minutes. Just let it all hand out. Dont filter, don't cross  out, don't correct. Do it by hand and just write and write. 

Some of it will be crap, but you have to dig deep to find the good stuff and move a lot of dirt out of the way to find the gold. (Goldbloom). I've done that kind of writing from time to time. It's been freeing.  Relaxing. I'm just getting my chaotic thoughts and wrestling them onto the page and taping them there. It's like an exocism for some problems, like speaking the name and giving strength for others. But I feel better afterwards, but you only want to complain for so long before you want to write about something else. 

# "Morning Pages" - Source Unknown
I've also heard of the idea of "Morning Pages" and I can't remember who coined the term. But start every morning with two pages of free writing. Every morning. Every day. It's writing practice and unburdening your mind. 

It's a useful practice and something I'd like to cultivate more of. Sometimes I've got interesting things rattling around in my head that wants to get out. The least I can do is oblige it.
