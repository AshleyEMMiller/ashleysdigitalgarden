Science representations are the verbal and visual creations people use to depict a scientific idea. They can depict processes, systems or structures and may include literal or analogous texts/speech or anything in the range of images or videos/animations. [^1]

## Multiple representations
This is a way to approach teaching a science concept from different types of representations that offer different entry-points for understanding. Something like "triangulation"[^1]. 

## Multimodal Representations
This references the fact that by using different representations, you are inherently employing different modalities (e.g. words, images, symbols, movement, etc)[^1].
