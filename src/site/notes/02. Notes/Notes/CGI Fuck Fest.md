# Details
As defined by [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cgi%20fuckfest) a CGI Fuck Fest is a green-screen computer generated movie that's only purpose is to be flashy and have characters hit each other without artfulness. 

Some people [don't mind CGI fights in big budget movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/93vu2h/why_do_people_hate_cgifilled_final_fights_in/) but as Commenter [Kal-El-Skywalker](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/93vu2h/why_do_people_hate_cgifilled_final_fights_in/e3gi80n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) pointed out, there are issues of "Oversaturation". When all you get in movies is a massive fight scene in act three  with lots of explosions and flashing lights, it becomes old and predictable. 

I would also argue that pouring budget into a flashy scene that isn't actually moving is not worth the budget. There are lots of ways that CGI can be used to great effect in films for [[Good Storytelling\|Good Storytelling]] not just substance-less flash. A good example of a situation where the CGI fight at the end detracted from the story was [[Wonder Woman's movie fight scene against Ares\|Wonder Woman's movie fight scene against Ares]].
