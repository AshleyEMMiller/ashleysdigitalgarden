Hall's Cultual Iceberg Analogy was coined in 1976. Edward T. Hall observed that what we think of as culture, the tangible outputs such as the products, and holidays (defined as Surface Culture) are only small percentage of what culture is. 

Deep culture incorporates elements of [[Worldview\|Worldview]]. It includes communication norms, norms of behaviour, attitudes towards individuals, nature, behaviours, beliefs about abstract concepts like time, self and ethics. 

These deep cultural elements are expressed through surface culture, but surface culture cannot exist without the deep cultural elements. Deep culture is intangible and invisible and deeply integrated into the every day life of people within that culture. 

It is important to remember that culture is ever changing and an iceberg floats along through space, but aside from melting it doesn't not change much.

This is why [[Cultural Appropriation\|Cultural Appropriation]]  is actually a problem. It's the taking of Surface Cultural elements without recognizing, understanding or respecting the deeper cultural elements that support it.

"I'm just appreciating your culture," is not a valid argument. True appreciation would be humility and learning about how  the tangible output fits into the intangible culture.
