# Purpose Statements
## Madlibs Techniques
1. [[Your Core Values\|Your Core Values]] Write down three core values that define you (Chapter 4). This is hard to narrow down into values for your whole life, so you can select values that align with a time frame, an area of your life or other segment. 
2. [[02. Notes/Notes/Your Star Qualities\|Your Star Qualities]] Write down three Star Qualities that you enjoy doing that fills you with energy. 
3. [[Your Impact\|Your Impact]] Who do you want to serve, support or help? What cause or audience do you want to spend your time contributing to? Who do you want to be around? Who do you want to learn from?

>[!performance] Because I value VALUES, I will use my first for STRENGTHS to make a positive difference for IMPACT.

They can be rephrased to be more grammatically correct.

## Tombstone Technique
- Imagine you've died and on your tombstone it says: 
>[!success] YOUR NAME. A person who PURPOSE.
- What single sentence sums up what your life was about? What mattered to you most? It should crystalize your vision and purpose. 
- Now, reflect on how close or far you are from this statement. How can it guide you to move in the direction you want to take?

# Commitments
## Purpose-based Commitments
Example areas
- Family
- Relationship

Each area of your life can involve a series of commitments based on your values. 
Select some to be a top-commitement
Commitments should be things you want to not shoulds. 

## True Rewards
{ #d57050}


- We want rewards even though altruism is reinforcing. But those rewards are personal. 
- Rewards are more meaningful if they are intrinsic rather than extrinsic. 
- What rewards are meaningful for you? 
	- Legacy?
	- Control?
	- Security?
- Is the reward attached to your core values?
- The rewards that give the most long-term feelings. But this is very personal. 
- This is similar to the Currencies framework from The Maker's Collective. 
- Ensure that you have commitments in all areas of your life. 
- Narrow them down to a top five

>[!quote] The point is to realize that you can do good for others and do well for yourself especially if your clear on what rewards motivate you to move ahead. 

# Prioritize
Millions of people make New Years resolutions and we know that people like politicians make lots of promises that they claim are priorities but we know that not everything can be a priority. We are not so honest with ourselves. 

- [ ] In fact, the work priority was at first singular. There can really be only one priority. #ToDo/Research

We only have so much willpower and self-control to spend, and we need to decide where to dedicate our energies. 

Having a long list of commitments is good, but keeping the active commitments list small will mean it actually happens. 

Use the true rewards list to help decide which commitments to prioritize.
