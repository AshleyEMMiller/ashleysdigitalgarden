Zionism is a secular movement by those of Jewish descent to occupy the region of Palestine as the Nation of Israel. 

The Nation of Israel has political support from many Western and European nations. This relationship gives those countries an advantageous foothold in the Middle East at the expense of the Palestinian people. 

Many Jewish People oppose the occupation of Israel and the actions of the Israeli Government. Including Rabbi Yisroel Dovis Weiss, who, in an Al Jazeira interview said:

>[!Quote] Well, Zionism is a mere 150 years. It's a sort of transformation to nationalism to have a piece of land. It's a materialistic movement that was started by Jews who were non-religious. They then simply incorporated using the name Israel, using the Star of David, and claiming that it's given to them by God.
>- Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss ([^AlJazeira20231015])
