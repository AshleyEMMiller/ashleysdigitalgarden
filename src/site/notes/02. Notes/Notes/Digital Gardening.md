# Digital Gardens - An overview

Digital Gardens are similar to a blog, but are thematic, constantly updated and living websites [^Le Cunff - Digital Garden]. A collection of notes, captures, finished pieces, and (depending on the tool) doodles, they showcase the creator's work and their behind-the-scenes thinking process. Another characteristic of digital gardens is that they are not chronological but conceptually ordered. Bi-directional linking allows readers to meander across different knowledge paths and ideas. 

Digital Gardens afford the creator a self-owned platform for [[02. Notes/Notes/Learn In Public\|learning in public]] and [[Continuous Improvement\|Continuous Improvement]].

## Mind Gardening
>[!quote] A mind garden is not a mind backyard. It's not about dumping notes in there and forgetting about them.
>- Anne-Laure Le Cunff [Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden)

Ann-Laure Le Cunff articulates the connection between a mind garden and a digital garden in her Ness Labs article [^Le Cunff - Mind Gardening] She begins with the French expression for "tend to your internal garden" as a metaphor for taking care of your mind. She considers it from the perspective of cognition and knowledge (which is relevant to this context) but I'd be curious about other ways to apply the term and concept. 



She emphasizes the importance of exploration and eureka moments, note making in your own words, mindful consumption from diverse sources, developing unique perspectives and consistency. I particularly like the quite above about the mind garden not being a mind back yard. (Out backyard often is left to its own devices and there are corners that I forget about until the young dog weedles her way into it and then it becomes My Problem™️.) 

>[!key] Keys To A Mind Gardening Practice
>- Allow Time for Exploration
>- Mindfully Consume from Diverse Sources
>- Make Notes In Your Own Words
>- Develop Your Unique Perspective
>- Tend the Garden Consistently

Le Cunff leans into the horticulturing metaphors (which a few other digital gardening writers have also done). She describes "reading broad content" as a way to "plant many seeds", you can generate new ideas by "replanting stems and cuttings from existing ideas", and you can get the word out by sharing "seeds with fellow gardeners". 

The article ends with insights into taking the mind gardening approach and making it tangible and public-facing with a digital garden. There are five examples of influential digital gardens and Le Cunff references Maggie Appleton's list of digital gardens. 

One thing I disagree with is Le Cunff's idea of only migrating completed "evergreen notes" to the public digital garden. Or perhaps I have a different idea of what an evergreen note is. But I prefer the idea of being able to share developing ideas in the digital garden as a way of showing your thinking and learning.

## My Approach Digital Gardening
From my reading, people seem to either be in the "Publish everygreen notes only" or "these notes are an incomplete mess for myself" camp. I'd like to employ a hybrid of the two. Due to the tools I'm using to publish my Obsidian Vault, I'm going to publish each note, one at a time as I've had a chance to look it over. The notes may not be complete, but they will be coherent and have at least one finished thought to them. Since I have to select the notes to publish to the digital garden manually, it gives me a chance to tidy my notes up into something more polished and valuable to my future self. It will also help me unearth old notes that I've forgotten about. I'd like my notes to be valuable to other people, and since I'm more likely to do things for others than myself (accountability), then it will be useful for future me. 

I will have a collection of text notes, photos, Excalidraw visual notes, training logs and more. The wonderful thing about Obsidian is that Editing mode and Reading Mode look different and I can make comments. The comments can be inline and include things like action items or the specific name of a person who told me something (which I may not want to include in my public published notes). 

A consequence of taking the time to create a digital garden is that I realized that a lot of my notes are other peoples thoughts. I don't have a lot of my own writing or synthesis. I write about how I want to process my notes and spend so much time thinking about workflow that I don't actually do the work. So, the Digital Gardening process will force me to write out what I have floating around in my head so I can make it concrete, interrogate it and share it for feedback. 

# Notes as an Ecosystem - Metaphors for Status
Ann-Laure Le Cunff, in her Ness Labs article, describes the concept of mind gardening as a lead up to digital gardening [^Le Cunff - Mind Gardening]. She, along with other writers and thinkers about digital gardens uses the gardening metaphor to describe the status of notes. 

I would like to explore that concept for my own tagging system of note statuses but maybe take a broader view of the garden as an ecosystem. 

I can reframe fleeting notes, quick capture and random questions as seeds (🫘). It's a bean emoji but whatever. Notes I've given more thought to can be labelled as seedlings (🌱) , fleshed out and researched ideas as shrubs (🌿) and notes I'm done fiddling with as trees (🌴🌳🌲). 

I can apply the same framework to projects and outputs. My outward-facing work that's polished and to be given out far and wide can be framed as fruit (of my labour) (🥭). Social posts can be a flower since they're less finalized than a whole fruit and still capable of cross-pollinating (💐) but have been given out. 

External Inputs into the garden are nutrient-binding ground cover (☘️ or 🍀 depending on how valuable the source is). Personal anecdotes (🌻) are bright and can lead to new ideas or may be ephemeral and go nowhere. Someone else's ideas (from conversation) are like seed-bearing plants (🌾) from a whole other garden that was transplanted into mine. 

Individual Experts are solitary pollinators (🦋) that connect ideas and organizations are like bees (🐝)  because they're colonial. Collaborators are beetles who take and pollinate (🪲). Audience are like herbivores (🐢) who I want to offer things to at all stages.

Core Principles are more solid than the ideas, they're the values and beliefs that the garden is built around (🪨) and they can't be moved without a lot of effort. 

### How to code for emotions
EV Chapman of Medium, mentioned that all fleeting notes are framed as SparkNotes which are where her essay ideas come from. BEEAMP uses the tag "Build" for things she wants to use later. For myself, I will use ✨ to mark the idea/notes that I want to flesh out into an essay. 

 BEEAMP also uses an emotional tagging system to help her remember what appealed to her about her captures. For myself I would like to use the following tags.
- 🌀- Coming Around Again, A second or third pass at an idea that I'm understanding now, Enhanced Level of Meaning Making
- 🫙 - Something beautiful worth holding on to. 
- 🍄 - Been thinking about this for a while
- 🔥- passionate
- 🌤️ - hopeful
- 💥- perspective changing
- 🧩 - fills a missing piece

# Details
I came across the idea of Epistemic Disclosure in Maggie Appleton's post on Digital Gardens and the idea resonated with me because it liberates me from being right when I say things. I can articulate at the front of the note how much time I've dedicated to this idea and how confident I am that it's legitimate. It's like a written form of "don't quote me", which I say often in real life. 

I need something simple to implement and understand so it doesn't become laborious to do for every note and maintain consistency. It's good practice to reflect on how I know what I know and how confident I am in what I'm saying. 

Here is the coding system I'll employ at the top of all (non MOC) Permanent Notes. MOC's are going to be hubs for lots of notes and therefore each linked (or embedded) note will have its own Epistemic Disclosure Statement. Source Notes are directly from a source and I won't bother with the epistemic disclosure since the information about the source will be provided. 

- **Epistemic Effort** = ⛏️ (number of pick-axes out of 5 indicates how much effort I put into understanding this idea)
	- 1 = No External Sources
	- 2 = One source
	- 3 = Two or more sources
	- 4 = Three or more sources which legitimately counter each other
	- 5 = Five or more sources which provide nuance and context
- **Epistemic Certainty** (How confident am I that this is valid, generalizable)
	- 🥽 Uncertain
	- 👓 Semi-certain
	- 🕶️ Confident
- **Garden Status**: is more about where this idea is at in terms of thinking, processing and cleaning up
	- 🫘 - Seed (quick-capture, fleeting ideas, questions)
	- 🌱 - Seedling (processed beyond first thought, but still rough)
	- 🌿- Shrub (restructured, edited)
	- 🌴 - Tree (returned to and polished)
