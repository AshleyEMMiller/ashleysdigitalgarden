Consumer society is one where buying things is viewed a valuabe activity. The economic model seperates production and consumption as sources of economic growth. Prior to the 1950s and World War II, economic growth was focused on production. 

The outcome of this shift from production to consumtion is people's mindset about money and what is worth purchasing. In a production society, people saved up for what they needed. In a consumer society, with lots of easy options for credit, there is a mindset of buy now pay later. This resulted in a difference in the kinds of objects available for purchase and the justification people were given for purchasing. I.e. There are now lots and lots of items on the market that are not available based on needs but on wants. [^1]
