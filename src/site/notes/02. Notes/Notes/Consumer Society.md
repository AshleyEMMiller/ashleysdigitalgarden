Consumer society is one where buying things is viewed as a valuable activity. The economic model separates production and consumption as sources of economic growth. Before the 1950s and World War II, economic growth was focused on production. 

The outcome of this shift from production to consumption is people's mindset about money and what is worth purchasing. In a production society, people save up for what they need. In a consumer society with many easy credit options, there is a mindset of buying now and paying later. This resulted in a difference in the kinds of objects available for purchase and the justification people were given for purchasing. I.e. There are now lots and lots of items on the market that are unavailable based on needs but on wants. [^1]
