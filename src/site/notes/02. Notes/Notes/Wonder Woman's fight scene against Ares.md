Overall, I enjoyed Wonder Woman. I liked Diana's cultural background, naivety, and desire to end the war. But the fight scene at the end with Ares felt like it got slotted in there because a producer said there weren't enough explosions. The scene was flashy and overshadowed what should have been an emotional response to Ares' betrayal, having been at her side the whole time. Instead of emotional depth, we got fireballs and green-screen choreography.

The final fight scene was a departure from the rest of the movie and seemed like the kind of dumb action that an 8-year-old boy would enjoy with explosions and flipping cars.
