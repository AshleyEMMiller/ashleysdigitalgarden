I can use my strength of appreciating beauty and excellence to cultivate a sense of gratitude. This will help be find calm, peace and acceptance the frailty of life. By tuning in to this strength I can experience a heightened sense of meaning and experience awe and wonder. These all contribute to greater well-being. 

I can experience the emotion of elevation to be less self-centred. By observing acts of kindness, bravery, and fairness I can mimic that in my interactions with others. 

To practice this, I can keep a weekly log of moments in my relationships when I feel inspired by the actions of others.
