In 2022 we needed heating in our newly purchased home because the seller did not disclose catastrophic issues with the oil furnace rendering it inoperable. 

It took us several months to make arrangements with the electrician and installers and eventually get a new heat pump and water heater (which also needed replacing). In the mean time, the house was heated with oil radiators and there was a lot of back and forth. 

Supply chain issues made it difficult to confirm whether we would get the model we wanted (for the best Government rebate) and slowed down or minimized actual stock. 

After six months the whole process was completed and we were able to turn on heating in our home just before our trip to Ontario to pick-up Kibeth in February 2022.
