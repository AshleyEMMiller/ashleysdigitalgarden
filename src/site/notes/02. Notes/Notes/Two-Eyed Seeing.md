# Overview
## Definition and Origins
Two-Eyed Seeing ("etuaptmumk"  in the Mi'kmaq language) is a framework for bringing together Western Science and Indigenous Science and Knowledge. [^Donovan, 2023] 

The concept was co-developed with Mi'kmaq experts Elder Albert Marshall and his wife (who has since passed away) Elder Murdena Marshall along with a settler biologist from Cape Breton Univeristy Dr. Cheryl Bartlett. In the Marshall's home in Eskasoni the three developed the idea of "two-eyed seeing" as a way of bringing two perspectives into alignment[^Donovan, 2023] . 

Initially it came about as a way to redefine how science was taught, but is being integrated into the very practice of science [^Donovan, 2023]. 

>[!quote]   "As wonderful as science is, science cannot see nature from an Aboriginal lens...And the big difference there is that science sees nature as an object; the Aboriginal lens sees nature as a subject. Because it's through the language, it teaches you that everything is alive, physically and spiritually."
>- Elder Albert Marshall [Donovan, 2023](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/two-eyed-seeing-doc-1.6304574)


>[!quote] "[Mainstream science] has its strengths, and they are profound strengths, but it also has some profound weaknesses, and one of those major weaknesses is the exclusion of subjectivity. ...  From my experience working with elders and educators and students from the Mi'kmaw communities, I can see how in partnership, Mi'kmaw science can help counterbalance those tendencies in western science, but not just that. There are so many strengths within Mi'kmaw science and Indigenous science that our world desperately needs to hear about, and revitalize, for the benefit of everyone." 
>- Cheryl Bartlett [Donovan, 2023](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/two-eyed-seeing-doc-1.6304574)


## Integrated Science Degree Program at CBU
From 2001 to 2010 the trio (Bartlett, Marshall and Marshall) ran an Integrative Science Degree Program at Cape Breton University which combined [[land-based education\|land-based education]] with traditional classroom time. 

Indigenous students who participated in the program obtained value by seeing their culture as being valued and important, improving their engagement and performance. [^Donovan, 2023] 

## Two-Eyed Seeing in Science Research and Environmental Management
#### Bay of Fundy Tidal Barrier Monitoring
In 2017 an existing tidal barrier, which prevented seawater from inflowing into a river ecosystem failed. Despite recommendations from scientists, in 2019 the barrier was restored. Since then, researchers from Acadia University and local fishers work with the Confederacy of Mainland Mi'kmaq to keep an eye on the river and understand the barrier's impact on the local fish populations. [^Donovan, 2023]  

#### Maliamu'kik Msit Ko'kmanaq project
"Maliamu'kik Msit Ko'kmanaq" in English translates to "taking care of all our relations". This project is based at the Unama'ki Institute of Natural Resources and conserves the habitats of species at risk. They combine Western Science techniques (such as transect lines) with the traditional tracking knowledge of local knowledge keepers to understand the behaviour and locations of species like lynx.[^Donovan, 2023]  

## Weaknesses
One weakness of two-eyed seeing, as an approach is that it becomes a box ticking exercise. The concepts are not truly integrated into the thinking patterns of the settler participants. Moreoever, that lack of deep, integrated understanding and valuing of Indigenous science and knowledge is demonstrated fiscally and Indigenous knowledge keepers may not be compensated as robustly as other consultants. [^Donovan, 2023] 

Another weakness of two-eyed seeing is that it has become synonymous with all forms of integrating Western and Indigenous Science. Two-Eyed Seeing, while valuable, is a Mi'kmaq-based concept, it is  not the only way of integrating Indigenous and Western sciences; in fact there are many other frameworks [^1]. The point is that two-eyed seeing runs the risk of enforcing [[Panindigeneity\|Panindigeneity]], a failure to recognize the diversity of Nations and tribes within Indigenous North America. 

Two-Eyed Seeing was developed in the 1980s by [[Elder Albert Marshall\|Elder Albert Marshall]] and his late wife [[Murdena Marshall\|Murdena Marshall]],  [[Mi'kmaki\|Mi'kmaki]] living in Cape Breton alongside [[Cheryl Bartlett\|Cheryl Bartlett]] from Cape Breton University. Initially the approach was designed for a more holistic and inclusive approach to science teaching but now it's being implemented in the way science is conducted.  [^1]

At it's core, Two Eyed Seeing allows Indigenous Knowledge to be taken into account and at the same importance as Western Contemporary Science. Partly to ensure a more holistic and less contextually divorced view of the world. But also to reconcile how science was designed to erase cultures and enact genocide. [^1]

Initially Two-Eyed Seeing was part of CBU's Integrative Science Degree Programm which combined western science classes with land-based teachings. [^1] 

The biggest limitation, thus far, is that Two-Eyed Seeing is written as lip service rather than truly integrated into projects and outcomes. [^1] 

In addition to the benefits of Two-Eyed seeing as a way of gaining a more nuanced view of natural systems, Indigenous students who experience this approach feel a sense of importance to the scientific process, the opportunity for representation of their experiences and identity can make science more relevant to them. [^1]

Research Projects that integrate Two-Eyed Seeing include: 
- Bay of Fundy River Barrier Monitoring Project [^1]
- Maliamu'kik Msit Ko'kmanaq project: protects species at risk by protecting their habitats and combines transect searches for species like engandered lynx and tracking alongside an Indigenous Knowledge Keeper [^1]
