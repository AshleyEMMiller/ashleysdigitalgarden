I'm currently listening to a lecture series on Creativity and the Brain. It's fascinating and the lecturer talks about three types of practice:
1. Na√Øve Practice
2. Purposeful Practice 
3. Deliberate Practice

Each have varying degrees of effectiveness and will push you from level to level. The key to radical improvement is to push yourself in your areas of **weaknesses**. Practice should be difficult. 

If we only practice what we're comfortable with, we won't improve. Just today, I had to really push my left arm to lift a 25lb weight six times. I told my personal trainer that I didn't think I could do it and she told me to push and she supervised to make sure I didn't drop the weight on my face (and gave me a boost when it got really hard), but she didn't let me drop the weight because it was too challenging. I did four of six reps then took a break. And was able to manage the final two. For the third round, I did four, then one then one with breaks in between. But I still did the six. Even though I felt like I was trying to push up wall for all that my arm was moving. It was so hard. I'm going to be unbelievably sore. But I took care of myself afterards and went into the hot tub. 

I struggle with wanting to be good and wanting to feel good. I want to be known for being good, but I'm not always willing (or able maybe) to put in the work. To do the deep learning required to improve. To take the risk of putting myself out there and just going for it. 

The lecturer also talked about the 10,000 hour rule and how the original developer of the theory got annoyed about how it was taken out of context. He countered the popular writings based on his work to say that 5,000 hours of  high quality practice was worth more than 20,000 of poor quality practice. 

 There is also a value in quantity. But I think that applies more to finishing work. By finishing things and putting it out there, we can get feedback, make adjustments and move on. Perhaps [[Learning In Public \|Learning In Public ]] is an example of deliberate practice in the sense that there is a feedback component to learn about areas of improvement
