As for your comments about subject matter, I'm not committed to any particular wording so feel free to rewrite or change things, but I'll explain what I had in mind and then that might help with tie direction we take this.

I took the term "explicit" from the Discord server and I think that it is a bit more "objective" than "gratuitous", both of which are on a sliding scale. 

A personal example to explain my thoughts on gratuitous vs explicit would be the movie *Pulp Fiction*. I *really* didn't like it and came out of it thinking, "I wish I hadn't watched that". There was a lot of violence and some sexual content. I felt they were gratuitous at times, but at other times I could see where the director was going with it. Some people may disagree about how "gratuitous" it was, and I think even the director would disagree. However, I found the very explicit on-camera scenes or images more distressing, despite the fact that they sort of/sometimes drove the story plot.
