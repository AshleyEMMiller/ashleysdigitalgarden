When I was a child, we had a coconut tree in our yard. It wasn't anything special there were plenty of coconut and palm trees. This was the only tree that could grow in the yard though. The ground had been carved ut of a cliff face with a bakchoe and the regulary thin soil was more or less nonexistent. 

The tree was short and wth a ladder, or mayeb even not a ladder, my dad could with  cutlass get a few cocnotus down from time to time. We did this for ourselves as a treat. When my mother's family from the UK visited they got to have fresh coconut water and coconut meat. 

I have vague memories of opening a coconut myself. Ipbviously I was not allowes a cutlass so I threw it on theg round over and over until there was a split in the fibrous shell enough that I could tear it open and then pull the layers off one by one until I got to the hard ball of the coconut meat shell.

Coconut water is tranlucent white. Not sweet, but not really tasting of coconut. It's been years since I've had fresh stuff but I remember a kind of tartness to it. But a luke warm freshness. If the coconut was young, the meat hadn't hardeend and you ended up witha  jelly. Which is, as it sounds, as though coconut meat, rich and fatty hasn't quite set and is still a  bit of a blobby gel. That's something you could eat with a spoon. 

Getting the water out of a coconut was a lesson in air pressure. If you just put one hole to get the water out, it dribbled out into a glass or not at all. You had to have two holes. I never really understood the why of it at the time. but it was like how a can of condensed milk wouldnt pout with just one hole in it. You had to have a whole on the opposite end. If it got gummed up the contents woudn't pour. 

But once the coconut was empty of water, you could break open the coconut and get at the meat. I don't remember how I would have done this on my own. if I did, it was probably my typica brute force tactic of throwing it on the ground until it broke. The meat youn could pull out with a knife, if you got it behind the bulk of the meat. Coconut has a skin, brown and really tough. You ate the meat off of that if you could, pinching it off with incisors. 

Sometimes the cocnout fell green, and it had coconut jelly.

Yellow coconuts had hard meat around the water. 

But sometimes the coconuts fell to the ground and we had no time or interest in eating them and they dried out, grey husks. For some reason, I thought that was where coconut milk came from. The meat and the water condensing to form milk. 

I was 35 years old when I learned that coconut milk is made from the meat. Mind blown. And all of these memories and assumptions came back. Irontically despite the fact that we had a coconut tree, if we needed coconut milk for something, like peas and rice, webought it in a can. I think. But a recipe online of someone making Jamaican Rice and Peas as a child commented on gra
