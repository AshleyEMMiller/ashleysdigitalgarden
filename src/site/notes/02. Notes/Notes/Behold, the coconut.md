When I was a child, we had a coconut tree in our yard. It wasn't anything special; there were plenty of coconut trees and palm trees. This was, however, the only tree that could grow in the yard. Out family's lot had been carved out of a cliff face with a backhoe. The soil that was often described as "thin" all across the island, was non-existent on the property.

But the coconut tree in our yard was short. With a ladder, or maybe even without one, my dad could cut down a few coconuts with his machete and slice them open. When my mother's family visited from England, we gave them fresh coconut water and coconut meat. 

I sometimes opened coconuts myself. Obviously, I was not allowed to use the cutlass. So when a ripe coconut fell, I would lift it high overhead and throw it onto the ground over and over until the outer shell split enough that I could tear it open. That I could pull the fibrous layers away until I got to the hard ball of the coconut meat shell. As you can imagine it was time consuming and probably I was left alone to do this because it got me outside and kept me busy. (Despite the risk that in my perpetual clumsiness, I could have thrown a coconut on my toes.)

Coconut water is translucent white and doesn't taste like coconut. It's been years since I've had fresh coconut water, but I remember a tartness to it—a lukewarm freshness. 

Getting the water out of a coconut was a lesson in air pressure. If I used a corkscrew and just put one hole to get the water; it dribbled out or not at all. I had to have two holes. I never really understood why at the time. But it made sense. It was like how a can of Carnation milk wouldn't pour with just one hole in it. You had to have a hole on the opposite end, too. 

But once the coconut was empty of water, you could with less mess open the coconut and get the meat. I don't remember how I would have done this on my own. Likely it was effective brute force tactic of throwing it on the ground until it broke. Once the coconut was cracked, I could use a knife to pry the hard white meat from the shell. Coconut meat has a tough brown skin. You ate the meat from it, pinching it off with incisors. 

If the coconut was young, the meat hadn't hardened, and you ended up with coconut jelly. Which is, as it sounds, like the coconut meat, rich and fatty hasn't quite set. It's still a blobby, wobbly gel. Something you could eat with a spoon. 

Yellow coconuts had hard meat around the water. But sometimes, the coconuts fell to the ground, and we had no time or interest in eating them. They dried out into grey husks. I thought that was where coconut milk came from—the meat and the water concentrated to form milk. 

Anyway, I was 35 years old when I learned that coconut milk is made by blending the meat. And all of these memories and assumptions came back. Despite the fact that we had a coconut tree if we needed coconut milk for something, like peas and rice, I'm certain we bought it in a can. But I found a recipe online for Jamaican Rice and Peas. The author talked about grating the coconut to make coconut milk for the rice, and it was a very strange revelation.
