Dog training is a broad field that encompasses teaching domesticated dogs life skills to live as companion animals with people and their families, specialized skills to participate in activities and sports, service skills, and helping handlers overcome behavioural challenges demonstrated by their companion animal. 

There are several third-party certifications for professional dog trainers. The two I am most familiar with are: 
- International Association of Animal Behaviour Consultants (IAABC)
- Certification Council of Professional Dog Trainers
	- Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT)
	- Certified Behaviour Consultant Canine (CBCC)
# Personal Dog Training
As of 2019, I have a CPDT certification and have taught classes and private sessions with dogs and their handlers/families. I have been teaching in-person and online classes since 2016.

I own two Doberman Pinschers, Kibeth and Loki. Loki is retired, and Kibeth is my sports dog, who I originally intended to get competition-ready, but I am currently addressing her behavioural issues.
