I really like [[Dr. Brene Brown\|Dr. Brene Brown]]'s analogy of [[The Trust Jar\|The Trust Jar]]. How do the outcomes of science help, harm, or ignore different groups and how does that impact their trust in science?

Now let's look at the different ways that science is conducted: 
- academic/basic research
- industry
- government. 

Where are the places where trust is eroded? What are the actions that entitites engaged in science do to degrade trust? How do science institutions degrade trust (e.g. "Father of Gynocology" who experiments on enslaved black women while they were awake and without pain relief. Is given statues and the women remain nameless). 

How do we build [[Trust\|trust]]? 

Is the system conducive to trust? 
- [[Publish or perish\|Publish or perish]] forces output,output, output, without acknowledging that something experiments don't work. 
- [[Drawer effect\|Drawer effect]]
