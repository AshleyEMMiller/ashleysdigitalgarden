The Boots Theory, while merely as a musing from a character in a comedic fantasy book is a legitimate observation about the costs of poverty and how it enforces the cycle of poverty. 

The theory, outlined by [[Sam Vimes\|Sam Vimes]] of the Ankh Morpork City Watch states that the rich stay rich because they only have to buy high quality items once or never again as they can be retained within the family. Whereas poor people can only afford cheaply made things that must be replaced frequently and in the end spend more money on the same item for inferior craftsmanship and therefore experience the stress of a constantly replaced, but non-functional item.

>[!quote] The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. ... A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time andÂ _would still have wet feet_.
>- Sam Vimes (in [[Men At Arm\|Men At Arm]] by [[Sir Terry Pratchett\|Sir Terry Pratchett]])

In 2022, anti-poverty campaigner, Jack Munroe, pushed for the "Vimes Boots Index" as a legitimate marker for the disproportionate effect of inflation on those with less financial capital. [They received the blessing of the Terry Pratchet Estate to do so](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/26/terry-pratchett-jack-monroe-vimes-boots-poverty-index).
