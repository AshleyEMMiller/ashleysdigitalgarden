SMART goals are good for small outcomes but fail to meet expectations for longer-term ambitions. Originating in 1981 within the business context, SMART goals do not account for variability, uncertainty and shifting priorities. For example, can you plan to complete a learning goal in a set time frame when you can't predict how long it will take? 

The PACT approach, coined by Anne-Laure Le Cunff of [Ness Labs](https://nesslabs.com/smart-goals-pact), emphasizes continuous improvement over a blinkered target-focused approach. PACT stands for Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous, Trackable. It is similar to the idea of [[Outcome Goals\|Outcome Goals]] versus [[Process Goals\|Process Goals]]. 

A [[PACT Goal\|PACT Goal]] should be: 
- [[Purpose\|Purposeful]]
	- The goal should matter to your future supporting your passions and ambitions, to give you the motivation to persist.
- Actionable
	- The goal should depend on your actions, not external factors you cannot control. It places your focus squarely on the actions you can take today and resist the urge to plan the future to death. 
- Continuous
	- The goal should be flexible and able to start right now so that it can be built on or adapted to allow for continuous improvement. This prevents you from falling down the research rabbit hole and [[Movement is not momentum\|mistaking movement for momentum]]. 
- Trackable
	- Trackability is another element that places control in your hands. Rather than measuring externally controlled metrics, answering a simple yes or no on "Did you do the thing?" is much more effective and keeps the scope narrow for sustainable success.
