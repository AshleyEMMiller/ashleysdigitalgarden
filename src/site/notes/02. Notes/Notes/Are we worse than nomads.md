The Ontario Science Centre will be torn down and rebuilt at the waterfront. Doug Ford's reasoning is that they will build new houses. I was talking to a friend  (who worked there), and he did comment that the building is old and leaks. 

So instead of caring for buildings, which is why its flling apart, we neglect them,  complain that they're in disrepair and then move to somewhere else and destroy what was built. 

At least nomads travel light. Break down and take with them. Impermenance is their way of life, but they traad softly. the Impermenance of western society is heavy-footed and wasteful and short-sighted. 

In Europe there are buildings that have stood for centuries and we in north america tear down a building that was built 60 years ago because it's "tired"
