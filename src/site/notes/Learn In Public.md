I first came across the term "learning in public" from YouTuber Nicole van Der Hoeven, where she emphasizes sharing her learning as she goes. She positions herself as a guide (merely a few steps ahead in the process), instead of a guru (who appears to have it all figured out). [[Use it Or Lose It - How to Create things with your notes#^55a980\|Use it Or Lose It - How to Create things with your notes#^55a980]]. 

Austin Kleon popularized the idea of sharing your WIPs in his book [[📘 Show Your Work!\|📘 Show Your Work!]] back in 2014, which was the follow-up to 2012's [[📘 Steal Like an Artist\|📘 Steal Like an Artist]] . In Show Your Work, Kleon proposed ten suggestions for becoming "findable" instead of wasting time networking. His suggestions include: 
- Share something small everyday
- Focus on process not product
- Tell good stories. 

The term learning in public seems big in the tech developer community, where software and systems are changing so rapidly that industry professionals must constantly stay ahead of the curve through continuous learning and improvement. The specific phrase "Learn In Public" seems to have been coined by swyx around 2018. Their full (original?) article of the same name can be [here](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).  

The philosophy is simply that once you've learned something, "create learning exhaust" and make something with the new learning/skill/knowledge. While the creation, posting and sharing should be on a public platform, the emphasis here is not to become rich and famous with the work that you produce. The outcome is solidifying and articulating recent learnings; it's a gift to your future self.

By removing the goal of getting attention (likes, thumbs up, recognition), you don't have to worry about getting demoralized. This isn't **about** the accolades. It's about spending time teaching yourself.

Learning In Public is similar to [[Project-Based Learning\|Project-Based Learning]], where most adults learn to solve a problem (project) and pick up the necessary skills along the way until they reach the end ([[📘 The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition\|📘 The Science of Rapid Skill Acquisition]]).  

Learning in Public's notion of teaching others is similar to [[The Feynman Technique\|The Feynman Technique]]. The biggest connection I've made between the two ideas is that in The Feynman Technique in order to truly master a concept you must be able to explain it to a small child. Focusing on articulating concepts to a complete novice forces you to identify the gaps in your understanding that you might otherwise gloss over.
