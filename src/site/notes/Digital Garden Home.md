# Welcome
This [[02. Notes/Notes/Digital Gardening\|Digital Garden]] is where I share a curated selection of my notes and rough work (a lá [[📘 Show Your Work!\|Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon]]). The idea of consistently trickling out useful output for others to see goes by many different names these days: [[02. Notes/Notes/Learn In Public\|Learn In Public]], Working with The Garage Door Open, Content as Learning Exhaust, etc. Regardless, I'm excited to have a platform for synthesizing and sharing what I'm learning and doing without worrying about ads and algorithms.

Take a stroll through the garden. This site is organized by topic, not date (though I have timestamps for when things were updated). It's a living site, and everything is subject to change as I find new information and revise my perspective. Some of these notes are fully fleshed out; others are mere flashes of thought or questions. You can get a sense of where I'm at in the development process with the [[02. Notes/Notes/Epistemic Disclosure\|Epistemic Disclosure]] blurb at the top of each page. 

>[!plot]- A note on Epistemic Disclosure
>You can find more about this concept in my [[02. Notes/Notes/Epistemic Disclosure\|Epistemic Disclosure]] note. But in short, since this is a living, growing and changing set of ideas, I indicate at the top of each note the level of effort I've put into the note (or ideas within) and how confident I am in what I'm saying.
>- **Epistemic Effort**: how many sources did I use to come to this conclusion on a scale of 1 - 5 "⛏️"
>	- ⛏️ = No External Sources
>	- ⛏️⛏️= One source
>	- ⛏️⛏️⛏️= Two or more sources
>	- ⛏️⛏️⛏️⛏️= Three or more sources which legitimately counter each other
>	- ⛏️⛏️⛏️⛏️⛏️= Five or more sources which provide nuance and context
>- **Epistemic Certainty**: how confident am I in this idea
>	- 🥽: uncertain
>	- 👓: semi-certain
>	- 🕶️: confident
>- **Gardening Status**: how processed is this note/idea
>	🫘 Seed (quick-capture, fleeting ideas, questions)
>	🌱 Seedling (processed beyond first thought, but still rough)
>	🌿Shrub (restructured, edited)
>	🌴 Tree (returned to and polished)
