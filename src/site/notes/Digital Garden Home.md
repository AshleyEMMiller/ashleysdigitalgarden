# Welcome to my notes
This [[02. Notes/Notes/Digital Gardening\|Digital Garden]] is where I share a curated selection of my notes and rough work (a lá [[📘 Show Your Work!\|Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon]]). The idea of consistently trickling out useful output for others to see goes by many different names these days: [[02. Notes/Notes/Learn In Public\|Learn In Public]], Working with The Garage Door Open, Content as Learning Exhaust, etc. Regardless, I'm excited to have a framework for synthesizing and sharing what I'm learning and doing without worrying about ads and algorithms.

Take a stroll through the garden. This site is organized by topic, not date (though I have timestamps for when things were updated). It's a living site, and everything is subject to change as I find new information and revise my perspective. Some of these notes are fully fleshed out; others are mere clippings. You can get a sense of where I'm at in the development process with the [[02. Notes/Notes/Epistemic Disclosure\|Epistemic Disclosure]] blurb at the top of each page. 

>[!key]- How This Site Works
>This Digital Garden is my collection of highlights, notes, random thoughts, doodles, and WIPs on Obsidian. I publish it online through the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin, with GitHub as my repository host and the static site created by Netlify.
