# Welcome to my notes
This [[02. Notes/Notes/Digital Gardening\|Digital Garden]] is where I share a curated selection of my notes to show my work (a lÃ¡ [[ðŸ“˜ Show Your Work!\|Show Your Work! by Austin Kleon]]). The idea of consistently trickling out useful work for others to see is going by lots of different names these days: [[Learn In Public\|Learn In Public]], Working with The Garage Door Open, Content as Learning Exhaust, etc. Regardless, I'm excited to have a framework for synthesizing what I know into concrete notes and outputs without worrying about ads and algorithms. 

Take a gander around the garden. This site is organized by topic, not date (though I have timestamps for when things were updated). It's a living site and things will be updated and changed as I find new information and revise my opinions. Some of these thoughts are fully fleshed out; others are mere clippings. You can get a sense of where I'm at in the development process with the [[02. Notes/Notes/Epistemic Disclosure\|Epistemic Disclosure]] blurb at the top of each page. 

>[!key] How This Site Works
>This Digital Garden is my collection of highlights, notes, random thoughts, doodles, and WIPs on Obsidian. I publish it online through the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin.
