When we frame learning as "meaning-making," we recognize that learning is an active and deeply personal act where culture, personal history, identity and emotions are all involved. In fact, in certain schools of thought, learning is defined as the moment when a piece of information becomes personally meaningful to the learner. [^1]

There are three potential levels of meaning that relate to learning: 
1. **Semantic Meaning**[^1]
	- Language, signs and symbols as a way of relating to the world
	- The meaning is constructed in social situations (it is a joint activity) where the learner is socialized into the cultural systems of meaning (conveying socially agreed Intention and Normative uses)
	- Activities, situations and actions convey the meaning of objects, language and actions. 
	- There can, at times, be a tension between the socially shared meaning and the individual meaning that a person may ascribe in a context based on their own experience. 
2. **Pragmatic Meaning**[^1]
	- Social practices of a culture as a way of relating to others
	- Learners need to develop proficiency in cultural practices in order to participate and progress into the culture. The meaning motivates the learner as there is a clear path ahead to attain status or recognition. 
	- Learning, in this context, involves [[identity\|identity acquisition]] as part of a community or [[02. Notes/Notes/Communities of Practice\|community of practice]] . 
3. **Existential Meaning**[^1]
	- Learning within a person's life path; life-meaning
	- Often catalyzed by disruption that may lead a person to question their current situation and direction. 
	- Highly relevant to adult learning and [[transformative learning\|transformative learning]]
	- Also can be the process where emotional life experiences are processed in the mind into something describable and tangible, i.e. they gain [[semiotics\|semiotic shape]] from abstract/subjective to not necessarily concrete but at least describable. 

### Research into Learning as Meaning Making
Current research into meaning-making focuses on improving learning by analyzing teaching-learning settings, identifying ways to improve them, and gaining an understanding of thinking [1]. The research answers some questions but raises others about the transferability of learning from one context to another and the role of individual subjectivity in the learning process [1].
