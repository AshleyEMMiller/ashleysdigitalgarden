Unknown Speaker
Join me. Let's start with defining purpose and exploring the highlights from the most exciting research of the last decade on the many benefits of taking steps toward purposeful living. Based on my research and work with 1000s of people at all stages of life, from college students to folks in retirement. I define purpose as using your strengths to live in keeping with your values and positively impact the lives of others.

Unknown Speaker
As much as it guides those bigger questions of existential meaning. There's a wonderful parable about a traveler who came upon three men working he asked the first man what he was doing, and the man said he was laying bricks. He asked the second man, same question, and he said he was putting up a wall. When he got to the third man and asked him what he was doing. He said he was building a cathedral. They were all doing the same thing. The first man had a job

Unknown Speaker
that's a fancy way of saying it makes you feel more in control of your life. And when you feel more in control of your life, you're more likely to achieve your goals. That leads to life satisfaction, because you're doing something that matters to you, and doing it well. But let's pause for a second to define our terms again, because having a purpose and having a goal are two very different things. Purpose is why it matters. Goals are how to make it happen. The aim is to go a little crazy. These are to be taglines but pack a big punch. Your interest is piqued and you want to know more what's gonna happen. Perhaps it's a quote that you love that guides you. Maybe it's something you say all the time. Coming up with a tagline or slogan for your life is a good way to crystallize your commitment to purposeful living to a particular vision and to be the change that you hope to see in the world.

Unknown Speaker
For you, it's worth considering their advice, and perhaps even testing it out. But when we talk about supportive folks, especially in our careers, we enter the realm of weak ties. This is a concept that I stress to all my students and is a crucial aspect to any networking success. It's not our best friends, the strong ties, who helped us get a job or see the world in a new way. It's the folks who we see most frequently with whom we're less close

Unknown Speaker
the challenge is to think differently and had a new directions. Sociologists rose closer argues that we only hang out with a homogeneous group of folks who are similar to us. We're limited in a way we think, for each area of your life. Think of two people you might ask for advice and guidance. There should be people from whom you would see trusted support on your path to purpose. One of the people you list should be someone very close to you, the inner circle and someone whom you might talk often with because this exercise to identify the weak ties in your life that can help you. Achieve your vision and live your purpose. For each category. Think of someone in your outer circle to who you can periodically ask for advice on big stuff and whose opinion you trust in that particular area. The point of mentors and personal board directors is to create a sounding board and a support system to help you crystallize your vision. And your individual purpose and achieve your goals.

Unknown Speaker
introduced my methodological perspective of human ecology, the human ecological perspective looks at our interdependence with our natural and built environments, recognizing that our place where we live, where we work, where we vacation, what we see on a daily basis really impacts our wellness Well, it's not a surprise to any of us that green spaces are important. You might be surprised to know just how important it is to get out into nature. public parks in cities or national parks, acres and acres of wilderness, there's something about green space that seems to feed a primal need in humans. In wellness and medicine research is being done on the benefits of biophilia. How green spaces keep us healthy and happy. One study looked at the impact of nature scenes on stress. The study went like this, participants watched a stressful movie, and then the researcher set them into several recovery conditions. Some participants were put in a room with posters with natural seeds. Others were put in a room with posters of urban environments lacking in nature. Green scenes resulted in faster recovery times. Greenstein has lowered heart rates and blood pressure. In another study 166 patients who had just undergone heart surgery were exposed to nature scenes. Some have an open water view others have a dark forest and others have an abstract painting or blank wall was controlling. Take a stroll outside leave your phone, iPad, all other devices at home. Just you in nature, or the city for a few minutes. Notice what's going on around you. Your neighbors moving in. Is it breezy? Are you anxious without your gadgets? Pay attention to all your senses and feelings. Tip number two, take a timeout. Again. Turn off your gadgets and do something for yourself. Take a hot bath, read a book, go for a run. Do a craft project. bake something or swing on the swings. Be with yourself. See what happens. Tip number three write in your journal, type or handwrite your thoughts deep and banal about what's going on your life, how it makes you feel and what you'd like to change. Journaling can be a great way to brainstorm about how you're living your vision for change the challenges of living a life of purpose and your hopes for the future. No one else needs to read this. So forget about grammar and spelling Just don't hurt your feelings. Tip number four make a list. One of my favorite coping techniques is to make a list of everything that is bothering me everything that I have to do or everyone I need to call email thank and follow up with. This kind of big data download frees your mind up because you don't have to hold all the worries in your head. They're right there on a piece of paper or a to do list on your computer or sticky notes on your desk. Then you can have the satisfaction of crossing things off as you accomplish your tasks. Here's hoping that makes you feel calmer and more productive question. I'm burnt out and isn't considered cool to go with the flow attitude prevails and you're worried that by admitting to your friends you care about something you'll be ridiculed or maybe it's your family that isn't on board. Mark had majored in business. His father was

Unknown Speaker
considered cool to go with.

Unknown Speaker
tends to spur you into action. And that's what purpose is all about. As the great self improvement guru Dale Carnegie wrote, inaction breeds fear and doubt, action breeds confidence and courage. If you want to conquer fear to not sit home and think about it, go out and get busy. Want to boost that attitude of gratitude? Here are four options. Option one, create a list of daily acknowledgments. Like getting out of bed when your alarm went off, or getting to work on time. Did you let someone cut ahead of you in line? Did you get a colleague Harlequin Mitchell's list was simple into the point. I held the door for a lot of people got all my work done till all my family members I loved them. Remember to take on my husband and say thank you to Australia. Now these are huge, all our little things to count. What have you done today that shows that you're on track to win on your purpose statement. Option to write a thank you note to God the universe or Mother Nature for making you you. Think about the talents, strengths and skills that you're most psyched about. And tell him or her how you're thinking about using them. Alyssa wrote, thank you for giving me the knowledge and decisiveness to be able to realize what I want to do as a career. Thank you for giving me the patience to listen and help my friends and family in times of need. Often three letter of gratitude to a mentor and family member or person in your life you've never properly thanked for helping you get where you are today. Tell him or her where you hope to go to. For example, mutual aid is another. There is not one other person in this world that has helped me more than you have. You solve every problem I ever have. And know how to make me feel better whenever I'm down and working to become successful because of you and I hope I can make you proud. I should keep a gratitude journal for five days right on topic that will create a happier future suggests Richard Wiseman in 59 seconds he's popularization of this academic research on Monday write about things for which you're grateful. On Tuesday. Write about some wonderful experiences in your life times when you felt loved or contented and describe how you felt at the time. On Wednesday. Write about what the future might look like if you achieved your goals. On Thursday. Write about someone important to you write him or her a letter about why you care about them. On Friday, review the previous week and write about three things that went really well for you. Question my friends and family aren't supportive of my purpose focus commitments help.

Unknown Speaker
Increases your likelihood to forgive others and makes you more generous, more outgoing and feel less lonely. It may also have positive impacts on your immune system, blood pressure, improve your sleep and make you more likely to exercise. One popular assessment to measure Gratitude is the grant s. This assessment was created and validated by psychologists Philip Watkins, Katherine Woodward. Tamara stone, and Russell colts have

Unknown Speaker
students and the broader public. I accept my fears and anxieties about not being perfect enough, not being helpful enough and fear for the future. And still today make conscious purpose based commitments. To make a fun big potato bar tonight. Take a bike ride with the kids and check in with my students. Let's do it together. Because I value and now you fill in your three core values for today or the particular arena of your life or the values. I will use my gifts for now you fill in your free court. Yes they give you one to use today or in a particular role you play or each day going forward to positively impact the lives of certain groups or individuals or causes you want to positively impact I except to my fears and anxieties about NPS list the top three fears and anxieties that might creep up as you do this work. Still today I will make conscious purpose based commitments to and then write down three specific things you will do today or in the days to come to live out your purpose. When you have that statement written down posted on your bathroom mirror make it the lock screen of your phone.

Unknown Speaker
Clarity of self is the stepping stone on the path to purposeful living. Because when you name and accept your fears, you liberate yourself to live in the light of your awesomeness. Because outrunning your demons is damn exhausting. Because the burden of being perfect is a heavy one. Because as hard as you try to suppress them those anxieties and fears seep out sideways

Unknown Speaker
that purpose and at least tried to make a difference in this world. One common type of fear so common that it gets an exercise all of its own is anxiety. In his book Pathfinder, author Nicholas Lorre calls these the habits. For example, you might say to yourself, I want to start my own business. Yeah, but that's for people with a lot more money and experience than I have. Or I want to ask Alex out

Unknown Speaker
in all these purpose based commitments, Amy decided that the most specific and measurable was the call to her elderly relatives. So she made a plan to prioritize time for those calls each week. What about you? Your true rewards list will help you narrow things down. Look back at your list of purpose based commitments and see which really speak to the true rewards that you're craving right now. Make a top five list of commitments. Ideally, these will come from several areas of your life. So focusing commitments. And remember to make these top five purpose based commitment to change a reality requires clear goals. Goals are stepping stones that will keep you on track as you live your purpose. And this is where we get down to brass tacks. There's Bob who wants to make

Unknown Speaker
the students who had been allowed to eat the cookies and the chocolates persisted in trying to solve the puzzles for more than twice as long as those who had been in the radish condition. Those who had had to resist the cookies and chocolates only lasted eight minutes on the puzzle. While those who ate the cookies or candy lasted about 20 minutes. exerting the willpower to resist the treats took energy the hungry students who had resisted the cookies

Unknown Speaker
on everything from potholes to job creation, because we know that everything can't be a top priority. But somehow we think our lofty list of personal goals is different. It's laudable, to want to shed those extra pounds and get into better shape. Organizing your closet and giving extra clothes to Goodwill is an excellent idea. And saving money will help you in many aspects of your life, but trying to do all of them at once. Researchers find is a recipe for failure.

Unknown Speaker
Reward she seeks the values attached to that reward or to be responsible with the money she earns and make good financial decisions for Samantha being loved and valued is a reward she seeks and because of that she values healthy relationships with family, friends and her community. With your vision and purpose in mind, make a list of rewards that means something to you and the values that are attached to that reward. Take a moment to write down some of those ideas or come move through these ideas in a bit more depth. Either way, it's fine. The point is to realize that you can do good for others and do well for yourself, especially if you're clear on what rewards motivate you to move ahead. Because now it's gonna be a bit more challenging. You got to start your purpose statement. You figured out the commitments in each area of your life that are most important to you.

Unknown Speaker
warm and fuzzies This is yet another time where being honest is really important. This is a personal list and yours should not look like anyone elses. Sometimes the rewards might seem random to others, but essential to you. For example, I realized that it was important that my research would be good cocktail party conversation. Yes, that sounds a bit silly, but it speaks to my core value of educating others and my vision of translating academic research so that it can have on someone's everyday life. So having people excited to talk to me about my research because a meaningful reward. For Alyssa being financially secure is an important reward she sees

Unknown Speaker
in storm. Think about whether the reward is attached to one of your core values, or is a recognition for a talent skill or strength that will help you live on your outward focus purpose. These are going to be the rewards that give you the most long term warm and fuzzies This is yet another time where being honest is really.

Unknown Speaker
Once you're satisfied with your answers, you might even pick one or two that are your top commitments, or the ones you'd like to focus on first. Now here's the thing, commitment to a goal isn't costless. Your choices have consequences. So it's important to really choose to commit yourself to something that you really do want to do. Not something that you feel you should do or that your parents want you to do. Review your list and cross out anything that rather than a value based commitment, to make sure that your commitments are right for you I encourage you to identify your true rewards.

Unknown Speaker
Now is the time to think about purposeful living in the present what purpose based commitments can you make today? One way you can do this is to think about the various facets of your life, your family, your work, your relationships, your spiritual life, your financial life and your free time. Create categories that work for you and think about what commitments you'd like to make an each. For example, Angie made the following purpose based commitments around her relationships, keeping in mind

Unknown Speaker
a big step toward discovering yourself to be a greater person by far than you'd ever dreamed yourself to be. Because by answering those three questions about your values, your strengths and your impact groups, you can begin to draft a purpose statement. It goes like this because I value and then you insert your three core values I will use my gifts for and then you insert your three top strengths to make a positive impact on and then in groups or individuals for whom you want to use your energies. For example, my reading because I value relationships, perseverance and creativity. I will use my gifts for translating research, making connections and organization to positively impact the lives of my children, my students and the broader public. Feel free to attack the wording a bit here and there to meet your needs. If it doesn't make grammatical sense. Don't get too hung up on that. Instead, the idea is to see how these ideas can interact and then to craft or recraft a purpose and mission statement that feels right to you. Because I value and you insert your three core values I will use my gifts for and then you can start your three top strengths to make a positive impact on and then insert the groups or individuals for whom you want to use your energies.

Unknown Speaker
Emotional power, here we go. First, in lecture four, we talked about your values. Write down three core values that define you. This is a big one. And often it's hard to narrow it down to three values that are central to all aspects of your life. So if you'd like to think about values that you'd like to focus on as core to what you're going to do for the next week, month or year, feel free to do that. If you'd like to think about the values that define you in a particular realm of your life, personal values, professional values, social values, you can do that too. Just take a moment now and write down three core values. You can pause this recording and come back to it when you got three values written down. Okay, Phew, that was the hardest one. Next, I want you to think about three things that you're good at three strengths, think in terms of one two skills that can do skills, stuff you enjoy doing that fills you with energy. What are your strengths, list three of them. Who do you want? To serve, impact or otherwise help with cause or audience? Are you willing to devote your passion and time to helping with your unique blend of talents and skills, interesting values? Don't want to be around. Who do you want to learn from? Who do you want to impact in a positive way? You can pause this recording and come back to it when you've got three strengths and three impact groups written down when you're inspired by some great purpose some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bones Patanjali and Indian sage is quoted as saying, your mind transcends limitations. Your consciousness expands in every direction. And you find yourself in a new, great and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties and talents come alive and you discover yourself to be a greater person by far than you ever dreamed yourself to be. Yeah, that sounds good.

Unknown Speaker
bed in the morning. Ideally, your purpose is something that will work in all elements of your life, not only in your work life, but in your personal, physical, spiritual and social life. This is a big task. And the purpose statement you made to as we work through these exercises might be more focused on one specific area of your life or a specific time period in your life. All that is okay. A purpose mindset means living purposefully, not locking yourself into one path forever. So don't feel like something that you're passionate about now, something that really speaks to your values and vision and get away for a while. You're allowed to change your mind as you ease into a commitment to purpose. One way to start is madlib style.

Unknown Speaker
Transition is often challenging because wanting something is not the same as committing to it. Desire is not the same as action. This is where most self help and behavior change programs fail. I'm sure you want to find your purpose, but are you committed to identifying and living it? Here's the sad truth. We're really good at doing what we feel like doing. But we're not always great at doing what we said we do. Problems with commitment isn't just a phrase you throw

Unknown Speaker
but they don't have to be. Brooks describes commitments as falling in love with something and then building a structure of behavior around it that will carry you through when your love falters. When you make a commitment to something you truly love, whether it's a spouse a job, a company or a school, it won't feel like you're putting on an uncomfortable lobster show. It will feel like you're taking off the show and becoming the shape you were meant to be
