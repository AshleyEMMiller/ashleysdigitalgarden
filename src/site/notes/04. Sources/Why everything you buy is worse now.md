# Highlights and Captures
The stuff we buy is slightly worse than it was ten years ago. This is caused by a couple of factors.

For context, in the [[Design Process\|Design Process]] producers have to find a balance between Manufacturability, Functionality,  and Appearance. 

## Our Buying Behaviour Has Changed
### How we buy
As we transitioned from tailored clothing, to department stores to numerous stores (e.g. Malls in he 1980's 1990's) to online shopping where we don't even look at the clothing. 

### How often we buy
The concept of [[Planned Obsolescence\|Planned Obsolescence]] as a government-mndated strategy was first proposed by [[Ernest Elmo Calkins\|Ernest Elmo Calkins]] in the 1930's during [[The Great Depression\|The Great Depression]], initially under the term [[Consumer Engineering\|Consumer Engineering]]. 

Consumer engineering is what drives fashion trends that make us want to buy new things for no  functional reasons. Or perhaps there are microniches. The result is that we buy a lot. 

Data: 
- 30% of UK people buy clothes once a month and 19% buy something every two weeks
- US report: 
	- Between 2000 and 2014 the number of clothes purchased per capita increased by 60% and items were kept half as long. 

### Our unwillingness to pay more for things
People don't want to pay more for something they bought a while ago even though labour cost have increased in that time. So producers have to cut costs to keep things as low as they were let's say ten years ago. 

Manufacturing then becomes the dominant factor in clothing design (overshadowing appearance, but mostly functionality): 
- More people to make things faster (Increases costs)
	- Cheaper wages (probably also decreases costs)
- Cheaper material (decreases costs)
- Stitching patterns that are not  as durable (saves prduction time and cuts costs)

I would add the additional factor of inability to pay more for things. Just because the company costs have gone up, doesn't mean that the revenue to share holders has gone down. 

This loops into [[02. Notes/Notes/The Boot Theory\|The Boot Theory]]

## Examples from Technology
- Originally when computers came on the market there were leaps and bounds between devices even two years apart due to leaps in technology. There were legitimate functional differences. 
	- This used to be the norm for tech
- But now Technology changes are not major, the differences are merely tweaks. This is meant to get us to buy more. 

Right To Repair
>[!quote] All these things come into the world. They didn't come with repair tools. They came in to be thrown away. 
>- Gay Gordon-Byrne ([[Repair Association\|Repair Association]])
- When things break they are intentionally not repairable. 
- Chips are on everything and companies get to control whether they make or sell repacement parts
		- [[Right to Repair\|Right to Repair]] advocated by [[Repair Association\|Repair Association]]]
- They don't sell tools or diagnostics or a diagram. 
- Sometimes they're impossible to fix because manufacturing corner cutting replaces screws with glue and other similar cuts. 

Fighting for the right to repair is important for technology
for clothing - learn to take care of the things that you have
Take small steps to take control of the process.
