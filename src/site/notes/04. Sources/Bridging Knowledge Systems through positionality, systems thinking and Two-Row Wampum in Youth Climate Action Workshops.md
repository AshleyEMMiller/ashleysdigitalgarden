# Highlights and Captures
## Introduction
 


## Session
- Start with a definition of who you are
- The presentations/project is for Kaniatarowanenneh 
- River Institute - does not have a visitor centre
- Project is a partnership with Ocean School (who create education resources for teachers about the ocean, in this context it's connections to the St. Lawrence River connected to climate change)
- the project is a collection of videos interactive activities and more
- Partnership with the Mowhawk
- The project is framed around the Two Row Wampum
	- Two-eyed Seeing is a framework used by CASC, but it is made by Mi'kmaw
	- This is a concept more relevant to the Mohawk Peoples and Anusheanabe
- Two row wampum is made of woven belts of beads from shells
	- Made to recognize agreements (between Indigenous people and indigenous and settlers)
	- Purple = the people, represented their agreement to retain their own ways of life and work along side one another but not cross over and to respect eachothers autonomy
	- Distinct for two-eyed seeing which seeks to combine indigenous and westnern knowledge
	- The Mowhakpeople feel strongly about using Two Row Wampum when other people might use Two Eed Seeing. 
- The Mowhawk name for the river the Kaniatarowanenneh 

## Sustainability Compass
- [[Atkins Sunstainability Compass\|Atkins Sunstainability Compass]] - is used through a partnership
	- Encourages students to think about problems in a different way, into systems and holistically instead of breakng it  down into little sections. 
		- N = Nature
		- E = Economy
		- W = Wellbeing
		- S = Society
	- Case study is Human Impacts on the Environment
		- N = Sturgeon
		- E = Fishing
		- S = Research
		- W = Culture
- The limitaition is that a compass is a very colonial construct and has no inherent connection to Mohawk Culture

### Positionality
Positionality includes the things that make up out lived experiences
- Gender
- Ability
- Race
- Ethnicity
- Religion
- Education
- Sexuality

Positionality influences how we perceive things and how we approach problems
- How can you ask questions about whether a
- The relationships already existed before the compass. They don't all ft into the single category they can fit into multiple categories

### The Activity
4. The circled hubs are the best, most high levereage points to start when dealing with the specific problem in the environment




Climate action: 
- it's alot easier to make a commitment if you're passions about it than if you've been told to do it/=

What similar tools can be sued to explore sustainability?
How can this tool be adapted for other settings?
How else can we better showcase indigenous knowledge and perspecitves when ti comes to STEM education
