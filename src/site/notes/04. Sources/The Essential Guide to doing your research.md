# Highlights and Captures
## 1- Taking the Lead into the Research world
### Ontology and Epistemology

- [[02. Notes/Notes/Ontology\|Ontology]]: What exists and how those things are understood and categorized
- [[02. Notes/Notes/Epistemology\|Epistemology]]: What are the legitimate knowledge generation frameworks, the rules of knowing

In social science there is ongoing debate about competing epistomologies and their resulting ontologies. Individual researchers will have their own internal relationships to knowledge and what is "true" and their preferences will impact the kinds of tools they are willing to reach for when it comes to conducting research projects and answering questions. 

### Competing Positions
Since the European Enlightenment era, the scientific method has been held as the unquestioned pinnacle of research which adheres to the following three ways of knowing: 
##### Realism
The external world and "truth" exists independently of observation or understanding. 
##### Empiricism
The corner stone of the scientific method; all knowledge can be measured or observed by the sense. 
##### Positivism
All true knowledge is scientific and can be best discovered by the scientific method. 

However, in recent decades the Positivist perspective has been called into question as the *only* legitimate ways of generating knowledge. There are elements of both the natural and social sciences that may never be truly captured in a "measurable"  way and as we continue to frame and reframe our epistemologies on the social and historical context we have to ask our selves "Whose truth?"

There are not a number of 'Postmodern' or 'Post-Positivist' epistemologies that are founded on accepting the complexity of the real world with its multiple perspectives, diversity, chaos and incompleteness. These include: 
##### Relativism
Nothing is universal, everything can only be understood within its social and historical context. 
##### Social Constructionism
The world is constructed by people as they perceive, interact and interpret it. 
##### Subjectivism
Subjective experiences is important and are the basis of factual knowledge. 

### The position of the reflexive researcher
Arguing between Positivists and Post-Positivists is a waste of time. Adhering too tightly to one set of methods puts researchers at risk of "methodolatry". A term coined by Janesick to describe: 

>[!quote] "preoccupation with selecting and defending methods to the exclusion of actual substance of the story being told"  and "slavish attachment and devotion to methods"

Rather, it may be more fruitful to acknowledge that different ways of knowing can be utilized in credible ways to further our collective knowledge because they employ disparate and distinct approaches and ways of understanding the world. Each research problem will be unique and a researcher may be better served by selecting the correct tool for the job than trying to shoe-horn a question and the ways of answering it into their preferred method of data collection or analysis.  

## 3 - Striving for Integrity in the research process
### Understanding the power game
>[!quote] "the existence of a scientific problem coincides personally with... specifically oriented motives and values"
>- Max Weber (1904)

The notion that research is purely objective wth no power or politics at play is a myth and the research community acknowledges that research shapes the our cultures' knowledge which further shapes the social landscape. 

Unrecognized power can deeply impact research by introducing bias and assumptions from their worldview and imposing them on the analysis and the research participants. 

### Credibility Indicators
|                                              | 'Positivist' Paradigm | 'Post-Positivist' Paradigm |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
|                                              | Quantitative Studies  | Qualitative Studies        |
| Acknowledge or manage subjectivities         | **Objectivity** - detached observations (removal of emotions, biases and subjectivities)       | **Neutrality** -  subjectivity acknowledged and managed to avoid impacting study  **Transparency** - Declaration of subjectivities and how it might impacts the study           |
| Capture "True essene"                        | **Validity** - aims for truth and correct conclusions or whether the methods and study design actually address the question                       |**Authenticity** - aims for truth, but recognizes that there are multiple "truths", or in-depth descriptions of experiences that are "true" to the experience                            |
| Consistent Methods                           | **Reliability** - data/results are collected in a consistent manner between samplings/trials|**Dependability** - reliability may not always be possible but presents systematic and well-documented methods that take subjectivities into account|
| Relevant and Appropriate Conclusions         | **Generalizability** - conclusions from a sample or situation are directly applicable to a larger population or a different situation                      |**Transferability** - observations or conclusions drawn from a unique population or situation may lead to lessons relevant to a larger population or a different setting                            |
| Verifiable Research                          | **Reproducibility** - Would the same conclusions be drawn if the same methods were used in a different study regardless of context                      |  **Auditability** - Research context is important and so provides in-depth methods so readers can assess how the authors reached their conclusions (even if the same methods could not lead to the same results in a different context)                          |

## Chapter 7 - Designing A research Plan

### Addressing your question (p91)
#### Working at the level of methodology
Familiarization is critical for selecting the most appropriate methodological framework to best support the aims and objectives of your research. In general, research projects are trying to do one or more of the following: 
##### Understand a problem/issue
- May involve either taking a broad approach to assess societal/population-level attitudes, opinions, or behaviours or a smaller-scale nuanced approach that examines the intricacies within a group or set of individuals. 
- Relevant Methodologies: Population study (large scale), Ethnography, Phenomology (small-scale)
##### Find workable solutions
- May involve assessing needs, ideating futures, identifying programs and services or interventions, or assessing the feasibility of a solution
- Relevant Methdologies: Front-end analysis Evaluative Research
##### Work towards a solution
- Research that goes beyond knowledge production to implement change as part of the project, e.g. changing experiences, practice or broader systems.
- Relevant Methodologies: Action Research
##### Evaluate change (i.e. success or failure)
- The goal is to answer whether an intiative has been successful by evaluating the outcomes, assessing the effectiveness of the process, or articulating its strengths and weaknesses. 
- Relevant Methodologies: Summative Evaluative Research, Formative Evaluation Research

>[!quote] "It can be difficult to work with an approach that conflicts with your own epistomological framework. In fact, there is no sence in understanding traditiona 'quantitative' study if you hold a well-considered strong critique of positivism/scientific method. Similarly, you will not be comfortable delving into the qualitative paradigm if you have a problem with the value of data not supported by statistics. You need to give real considerations to your own belief systems, as well as your willingness (1) to develop new skills/interestest and (2) to take on particular research 'roles'.

#### Research Roles
There are many metaphors for the role of the researcher. Some work better for certain projects, some work better for certain people and personalities. Regardless, the role are not mutually exclusive and each have their strengths and weaknesses. 
1. Theorist
	- Philosophical thinker that moves easily in the realm of abstract thought.  Interested in ideas and the theories of others as tools to explain phenomena or situations To develop knowledge that might fall outside of the dominant paradigm. 
	- Comfortable with various methods and methodologies
1. Scientist
	- Works to a formula and prizes objectivity
	- Most comfortable with quantitative paradigm
1. Change Agent
	- Prizes subjectivity as a basis for working towards positive change. Devoted to the research/change process and sensitive to study participants
	- Participatory and Collaborative REsearch, Action Research Strategies
1. Bricoleur
	- "jack of all trades" professional who approaches methods as emergent and dependents on the interaction between research question and context. Will use a variety of tools or make new ones to solve the research puzzle. 
	- Comfortable with various methods and methodologies
1. Chroegrapher
	- Researcher who starts with key principles and has a broad vision. They warm-up (preparation, exploration) before moving on to illumination and output. 
	- Comprotable with qualitative approaches.

### Getting down to the Nitty Gritty
#### Check-List for Methdological Plan
##### Who
- Who are your speaking about?
- Who do you plan to speak to or observe?
##### Where
 - What is the physical domain of your sample?
 - Are settings relevant to the credibility of your methods? 
##### When
- How do your methods fit your timeframe?
- Is timing relevant to the credibility of your methods?
##### How
- How will you collect your data?
- How will you conduct your methods?
##### What
- What will you look for?
- What will you ask?

#### Emergent Methodological Design
>[!quote] Fixity of purpose calls for flexibility of method. 
>William George Plunkett

It is important to have a research plan, trying to fit data to a question after the fact is not sound, nor will it lead to credible results. That said, life happens and researchers must be flexible to adapt their plans in response to reality of research (e.g. surveys are not returned, data could not be observed/found) and the project may need to be redesigned to work with what the team has. 

However, there are some framworks that build "emergence" into the process as a strategy. 

##### Grounded Theory
Researches use induction to generate theories based on the data they have collected. This is an iterative process that involves multiple phases to develop and evaluate theories. 

In the first phase of Grounded Theory:
1. Research question or topic is defined
2. Methodological procotol for first data collection is run
3. The data is analyzed to generate theories

The subsequent phases of the research is emergent based on the findings in the first phase and the theories that were developed. These phases may involve taking a second look at the data, applying new methodological approaches to gathering and analyzing new data. 

Researchers know that they cannot plan everything in advance and will bbave to respond to the data they collect and find. However, Grounded Theory as as a sound methodological plan, while fliexible and iterative is not ill-defined or ad hoc. 

##### Action Research
The goal is to work alongside stakeholders to create knowlege that will imediately be used to make change. Change for the stakeholders is a core part of this methodology  and so stakeholders are co-researchers with the main researcher who facilitates the team and develops the methdological plan. However, this participatory/collaborative approach means that the approaches are not fully under the control of the lead researcher. The stakeholder input means that the process is emergent and iterative to meet their needs.  

## 8. Understanding Methodologies: Quantiative, Qualitative, and 'Mixed' Approaches
The terms quantitative and qualitative are not appropriate terms for reseearchers, or even methodologies or even methods; rather they describe data and their analysis. 

### Qualitative Tradition
>[!quote] It's really about doing science differently...We're talking about a paradigm shift.
>- A. Johnson

The qualitative tradition counters the notion that positivism is the only valid way of creating knowledge and offers alternative epistemologies. Hallmarks of the qualitative tradition are that is: 
- uses both deductive and inductive logic
- Values subjectivities
- Accepts multiple viewpoints and realities
- Acknowledges power dynamics of research and participants
- May involve political agendas
- Values depth over quantity

The qualitative tradition values: 
- holistic meaning
- Natural-setting observations/studies
- Emergent methodological design
- Small sample sizes
- Selective/intentional sampling methods
- Rich qualitative data
- Analyzing through induction
- Idiographic interpretation
- The potential for negotiated outcomes (which recognizes that participants might need to be involved in the researchers analysis)

By using the above philosophies the qualitative tradition aims to explore and tease apart the complexities of social interactions, lived experiences, processes and beliefs that function at all levels of human life at micro- and macro-level scales. By engagement or immersion, the reality of people, their culture, places and systems can be deeply understood. 


#### Credibility in Qualitative Studies
Qualitative research is often looked down on for not reaching positivist standards of credibility. However, there are standards for credibility for qualitative data and analysis they are just different from those of quantitative analysis. 

##### Strategies for Achieving Credibility in Qualitative Studies
The following can ensure thoroughness, rigour, and verification
###### Saturation
- Continue to collect data until new data does not lead to any new insights or changes to theories. 
###### Crystalization
- "Building a rich and diverse understanding of one single situation or phenomenon by seeing the world as multi-faceted, and accepting that what we see depends on where we look, where the lights is, etc."
###### Prolonged Engagement
- Understand the culture and context of the people and build a relationship of trust
###### Persistent Observation
- Go beyond superficial, initial conclusions about a situation or event. 
###### Broad Representation
- To ensure that the community/group, institution or phenomena can be communicated about with confidence, capture wide representation.
###### Peer Review
- External evaluation from colleagues outside of the project
###### Triangulation
- Check source authenticity by using multiple sources to gather data
###### Member checking
- Ensure that interpretations of observations aligns with the interpretation of 'insiders'
###### Full explication of method
- Provide sufficient details about the methods and methodology so readers can audit or reproduce

#### Ethnography
The deep study of a cultural group's way of life from the point of view of participants. Stemming from anthropological research, it argues that this level of understanding is crucial to understand frameworks of behaviour and meaning within a population. 
Data collection methods include: 
- Observation
- Interview
- Document analysis
- Surveys

#### Phenomology
Research that emphasizes inviduals' perception of phenomena is the focus of this research regardless of the socio-historic context or "reality". It essentially explores lived experience. 

Data collection involves recruiting people who have experienced the phenomena (e.g. illness) and gathering data from them either directly or indirectly. 

#### Ethnomethodology
Studies the actions people take to navigate their day to day lives and social interactions. It explores the rules for ordinary life and how people navigate them. 

### Mixed Methodology
Mixed methods allow a researcher to use the best of quantitative and qualitative techniques and data allowing to leverage both deductive and inductive reasonining, numbers and depth. However before employing mixed methods it is imporant to understand the criteria for credibility inherent to both quantitative and qualitative data analysis along with the strength weaknesses of each paradigm to use them to their full potential. 

There are three main perspectives on Mixed Methods approaches. 

#### Quantitative Perspective with acceptance of qualitative Data
- Quatitative measures and assumptions are at the heart of the researchand qualitative data is used to  flesh out the data
#### Qualitative perspective with acceptance of Quantitative Data
- In-depth exploration is at the core of the study and quantified measures are periphery and can add breadth to  study in a way that can make it more generalizable/representative. 
#### Question-Driven Perspective
- The research question is at the heart of the study and the best tool for the job will be the one that solves the research problem most effectively and leads to the most credibly data. 

## 9. Understanding Methodologies: Evaluative , Action-Oriented, and Emancipatory Strategies
There is a spectrum in the relationship and research and application/change. On one end is a desire to understand current systems/situation, on the other end a core research objective is to change the dominant system. Along this spectrum, different methodological approaches best suited to meeting the project's goals. 

### Evaluative Research
Evaluative research assess the effectiveness of an intiative or intervention at either the Outcome or Process level and across the three main stakeholders: provider, recipient, community. When performing evaluative research, there are many political and interpersonal conflicts that need to be navigated on the part of the researcher. 

#### Outcome Evaluation (Summative Evaluation)
In this evaluation you can assess whether it was cost-effective (provider) or impactful for the provider, whether the recipients experienced change or whether community needs were met. 
- Provider
	- Data gathered from staff involved in design and implementation, leadership involved in organizational responsibility
	- Methods: 
		- Interviews
		- Focus Groups
		- Document analysis/review
- Recipient
	- Data gathered from the individuals who participated in the initiative
	- Methods: 
		- Experimental/Quasi-Experimental (using control vs treatment, before vs after, or a combination of both)
		- Interview/Survey of the post-intervention group
- Community
	- Stakeholders who are not direct recipients (e.g. in the case of a school bullying initiative, non-recipient stakeholders could be parents or teachers.)
	- Methods: 
		- Surveys
		- Focus Groups


#### Process Evaluation (Formative Evaluation)
Here, you would evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the initiatives process to make improvements for the provider, the recipient and the community. 
- Provider
	- Methods: 
		- Interviews (key stakeholders)
		- Focus Groups
		- Observation
		- Document Review
- Recipient
	- Surveys
	- Focus Groups
	- Interviews
- Community
	- Surveys
	- Focus groups
	- Interviews (key stakeholders)

### Action Research
This methodology is appropriate if the research aims are to generate knowledge and implement at the same time. Action research addresses real-world issues where the researcher and stakeholders are in a collaborative relationship. Initially developed in organizational behaviour, education and community development, there are other disciplines that employ this methodology. The key elements are: 
- Addresses real-world problems
- Persues action and knowledge
- Stakeholders participate
- Cycles of learning and action are built into the process

Action research can have one of the following scopes: 
- Improve Practice 
	- Stakeholders: Professionals seeking to improve their skills and knowleedge base(e.g. teachers, nurses, etc)
- Shift Systems
	- Stakeholders: Individuals part of an organization seeking to make improvements

### Emancipatory Research 
Emancipatory research aims to enact change by transforming the systems that are creating the problem. It aims to expose underlying structures and ideology and requires: 
- Criticality: Challenges the ways of knowing that we take for grants and asking if there are alternatives. 
- Radical View: Posing revolutioarny changes in the current systems (practices, places, ideologies)
- Emancipatory Goals: Working towards transformation

Two examples of emancipatory research are: 
- Participatory Action Research: empower communities to create their own knowledge and action for positive changes
- Critical Ethnography: exposes accepts systems to amplify marginalized voices as a starting point for individual, legal and policy changes. 


## 10. Direct Data Collection: Surveys and Interview


## 11. Indirect Data Collection: Working with Observations and existing texts

## 14. Analysing Qualitative Data
>[!quote] Note everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. 
>- Albert Einstein

Statistics rely on the reduction of meaning into number and there can be a subsequent loss of richness when the neuance, intricacies and complexities are stripped. In response, researchers developed a host of Qualitative Data Analysis approaches to interpret complex data without counting things. 

Examples of Qualitative data include: 
- transcripts (from interviews or conversations)
- Pictures
- Note
- Journals
- Videos
- Documents

The core steps of QDA must keep the research questions and objectives, the methodological constraints and theories in mind. However, the process can be cyclical at certain stages.
1. Organize Raw Data
2. Enter and "code" the data
3. Search for meaning through a thematic analysis
4. Interpret meaning
5. Draw conclusions

### The Logic of Qualitative Data Analysis
Both quantitaative and qualitative methods aim to make meaning from raw data. Quantative data must be interpreted usnig statistical analysis, qualitative data is processed using thematic analysis. The latter involves identifying themes that appear in the raw data and assessing how those themes relate to the research questions and the guiding theories.  The process relies on a balance of creativity and rigour to ensure credibility. 

### Moving Between Inductive and Deductive Reasoning 

##### Inductive 
- Exploring the data without pre-determined themes/theories
- Emphasis on discovering themes or theories as they emerge from the data
- Grounded Theory is a method of inductive processing
- Vulnerable to bias when unacknowledged subjectivities influence the analysis

##### Deductive
- Predetermined (a priori) themes and theories are used to analysis. 
- Themes/Theories may originate in
	- literature
	- Prior experiences
	- The research question
	- Insights from collecting the data
- Mining data for predetermined categories to support the 'theory'
- Researchers must be careful not to be tunnel visioned against alternative explanations and forcing the data into categories to meet their expecataions/question. 

### The Methods of QDA
#### Identifying Biases/Noting Impressions
- Because we're human and are constantly processing the information we receive, researchers will analyze as we collect the data, but this can lead to unconscious or conscious bias in the data colection
- To counter this, list as many assumptions and preconceptions as possible. It forces researchers to conciously recognize their biases (for management during analysis) and may help with developing catagories for thematic analysis
- Secondly, researchers can make note of general impressions after a first pass of the colected data to get a holistic view of the data and begin to identify topics and themes. 
#### Reducing and Coding into Themes
- line-by-line examination of raw data to systematically build categories
- At this stage the aim is to reduce the data and sort into themes.
- This can be done manually or through QDA software
##### Exploring Words
- instances, repetition, usage, and context (including cultural connotations and meaning) of words or phrases are explored
##### Exploring concepts
- Line-by-line or paragraph-by-paragraphy reading to compare the concepts with previously analyzed to see if there are similarities or differences.
- Concepts can come from the literature, ther esearch question, the institution, prior exprience, standards of social science (e.g. power, race, class, gender)
- Can be done deductively or inductively. 
##### Exploring Linguistic Devices
- We use linguistic devices (metaphor, analogy, idioms, etc) in speech and writing and analyzing these devices to categorize meanings of different concepts. 
##### Exploring Non-Verbal Cues
- Emotional expression, pitch, speaking speed, volume and even body language are all examples of non-verbal cues. If the researcher makes notes of them in the dta collection process it can lead to deeper insights about the participants data. 
#### Looking for Patterns and Interconnections
Once themes are identified, researchers explore them to identify how they connect either by connected the themes, concepts across themes, whether themes, concepts or linguistic devices are connected to non-verbal information. All of the above can also be connected to individuals in the study and their traits.  
#### Mapping and building Themes
Next, the data can be mapped into a mind-map or a tree structure. In a priori methods the map is predetermined, but in inductive/grounded theory, the map of data is developed as the analysis progresses. However this distinction is flexible and both mapping approaches can be used to arrange the data. Another review of the literature can inform the mapping process to inform a deeper understanding of the data and how your data fits into related theories. 
#### Developing Theory
The thematic analysis's mapping can lead to model building and developing theories as the process becomes more and more nuanced and complex. 
#### Drawing Conclusions
Researchers summarize their ideas into their conclusions and articulate why the important or significant findings from the analysis matter and how they relate to the project's question and objectives and the current literature. The conclusions can be shared in a "framework model" that clarifies the report and adds to research credibility by demonstrably contributing to the literature.

### Presenting Qualitative Data
When sample sizes are small, quantitative representations are essentially useless. Graphs are not where qualitative data's power lies. Words and images are the data and they are what makes it impactful. The most ideal way to capture the richness of the data is through storytelling. For this you need a clear message, argument/storyline and a selection of the best words or images from the data that give weight to the argument. 

#### QDA Strategies
##### Content Analysis
- Interprets meaning in a piece of text specifically related to topic or concept.
##### Discourse Analysis
- Interprets language in its socio-historical context that is tied to knowledge and power, not just "what" is said. Often this is "critical", in that is challenges dominant ideologies. 
##### Narrative Analysis
- Interprets people's "stories" with a focus on iterative story building where metaphors are important. Often used in phenomological research (the study of people's perceptions of phenomena or their experiences)
##### Conversation Analysis
- Interprets the structure of conversations where direct transcription is explores, the turn-taking of speakers is of particular importance. Used in ethnomethodological studies (studying how people navigate their everyday lives) that explore how people make meaning through conversation. 
##### Semiotics
- Interprets the meaning behind signs and symbols. It identifies the learning skills and mental processes used to make meaning by breaking the meanings down. Used in linguistics and humanitieis to understand how symbols are made and used the affect social consciousness. 
##### Hermeneutics
- Interprets the text through "dialogue" by moving in an out of the text and employing alternative perspectives (conventional vs. Critical, global vs. Detailed, etc.) to gain richer understandings. Often used in literature studies (documents, fiction, lyrics, theatre, artwork, etc.) where the meaning is assumed to be an outcome of the relationship between author and audience. 
##### Grounded Theory
- Generates theory directly from the data through analytical induuction and the use of a constant comparitice method that explores each data piece in relation to those already analyzed. 
- Used by researchers who value letting the data tell the story and not begining with preconceived notions. 
##### Visual Analysis
- Interpret visual or moving images. Can employ any of the above techniques.
