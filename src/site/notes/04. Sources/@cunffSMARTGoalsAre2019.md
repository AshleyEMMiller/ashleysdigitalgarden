# Highlights and Captures
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">A system without a goal is like a marathon without a finish line. But a system with a bad goal will result in a bad outcome.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=N8DMH2L6) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">Traditional goal-setting methods use the SMART framework. SMART stands for Speci=c, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timely. Sounds great for small, short-term goals, but not so much for ambitious, long-term ones.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=3745WF7B) 
## The classic approach to goal setting
- <mark class="hltr-green">SMART means. The acronym was coined by George T. Doran in the November 1981 issue of Management Review.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=H2ZVRLAM) 
[^Le Cunn 2019*] 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">et’s pick an example. Let’s say you want to learn how to code. It wouldn’t =t with the SMART framework of goal setting.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=CKBJ2PHJ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">How can you know how long this is going to take? What if you feel like it’s not achievable? What if it’s not relevant to what you’re doing right now, but instead you want to do this because you’re planning on changing careers or want to be able to work on a side project? Does this mean that learning to code is not a good goal to have in life?</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=3AF2ISKS) 
 
## Replace your SMART goal with a PACT
 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">the PACT approach focuses on the output. It’s about continuous growth rather than the pursuit of a well-de=ned achievement.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=IWHSPADX) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">PACT stands for Purposeful, Actionable, Continuous, and Trackable—the four factors that make for great goals:</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=RGR8B6DM) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Purposeful.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=AMVD3PBN) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Your goal should be meaningful to your long-term purpose in life, not just relevant to you right now.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=UM36QMHI) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">When a goal is aligned with your passions and your objectives in life, you are feeling much more motivated.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=ZJP28ICP) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Actionable</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=F3LWH4YA) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">A good goal is based on outputs you can control</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=KAIAJG8X) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">shifting your mindset from distant outcomes in the future to present outputs you can control and that are within your reach, taking action today rather than overplanning for tomorrow.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=M2YSRAAL) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Continuous. Continuous.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=7WLUCP6W) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">So many goals are not achieved because of what’s called choice paralysis. That’s when there are so many options that you end up spending more time doing research than actually doing stuff that will make you progress towards your goal. THe good thing about contiuous goals is their flexibility. What you need to do is get started and as you learn more you can adapt...It's about continuous improvement </mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=UCZD3BEQ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Trackable</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=GUAUNFJ5) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Stats can be overrated and don’t apply to lots of different types of goals. I’m a big fan of the “yes” or “no” approach to goal tracking, similar to the GitHub tracker.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=65SVS52J) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Have you done the thing or not?</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=S4TFLN5G)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">the =rst version measures success based on metrics that are largely out of your direct control, whereas the second version puts the emphasis on purposeful, actionable, continuous, and trackable progress.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZK22K8NZ?page=1&annotation=5XR9TL4A)
