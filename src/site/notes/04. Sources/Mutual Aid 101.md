#### What is Mutual Aid
>[!quote] "Loving kindness cannot be relegated to what we deserve is inconsistent We crave community that goes past deserving ness, what do I love you and how do we move together in tandem step.
>- Ismatu

- Emphasis less on what we deserve, but more on what do we owe each other and hwo do we move forward as our best selves?

>[!quote] Mutual aid is an unbroken tradition among indigenous people among many cycles of colonialism. Settlers have long worked to undermine self-sustaining ability. 

- A way to escape settler systems, and avoid depending on settler non-profits. 

- Mutual aid is a way to honour cultures and ancestors. 
- Colonization came with the emergence of individualism and society has made us feel that if we can't make it it's out fault. Despite the broken systems. If you don't have enough,you need to work harder. 
- Capitalism needs individualism.
- Placing blame on individuals and not on the systems. 
- It can be dehumanizing and frustraing to have agency taken away. 
- We can give each other need directly without strings and can build rapport and community. 
- For many BIPOC folks this is a way of doing things, But have historically being criminalized for participating in them. 
- Charity is not mutual aid. 
- It's important that White folks understand the history of mutual aid and don't exclude the people who have already been doign the work.

#### Examples of Mutual Aid
- Asusu 
	- A box hand. A bank by the people for the people
	- African concept to the West Indies. Used a lot by women in the group. 
	- Eveyrone donates ten dollars and each month everyone gets a pay out to 100 and allows people without bank access to 
	- A lot of agency and trust
- Phone Trees
	- Hong Kong's Response to COVID
- Church groups
- Buy Nothing Groups 
	- Give away stuff they're no longer using and people can give away stuff they no longer need without expectations for money or trade
- Bartering is another way of mutual aid

#### Things to watch out for when engaging in mutual aid
- Saviourism
	- We are used to the idea of needed to prove ourselves and we need something
	- Don't buy into the idea that you're a better person 
	- We are replicated saviourism. 
	- i.e. people who need help are painted as infantile or ignorant because they can't take care of themselves. 
	- But we should all receive help because we're humans who should help each other. 
	- Be mindful of not feeling "superior"
- Titles over experience
	- Education does not equate to competence
	- Education is not better than life experiene
	- What'simportant is that soeone can do the work, over whether they have taken an exam to prove they can do something
	- Education is a barrier to many communities
	- You can't learn how to be in community from a degree in school
	- e.g. you shouldn't just include people because of their titles, relate to their lived experiences as well
- Perfectionism
	- People don't need to be perfect, they need the help
	- We need to get comfortable with making mistakes. it's how we build bonds
- Avoid the Charity Model
>[!quote] the charity model is based on the christian model of the welathy giving alms tot he poor to buy their way into heave which relies on hierarchy. Only poor people who can prove moral worth deserves help
>- Mutual Aid book
- Charity has strings attached (either from the government or rich people)
- Mutual aid should never be that. 
- The person who's asking for help should be the ones making the decisions
- Conflict
	- Instead of preventing conflict accept that it will happen. Its an opportunity for self-reflection and learning perspetives and engaging compatibilities
	- Better to air it out than let it out and let resentment build. 
	- Deal with it despite the difficulty andhurt
	- Passive culture is very concerned with being polite based on the culture of professionalism (the child of white supremacy)
	- If someone brings something up we should be grateful for the oppotunity to duscuss
- Burnout/Capacity
	- Most of us are burnt out, but mostly people of colour are the ones carrying the weight
	- POCs are faced with a lot of adversity with trying to live this way. 
- To prevent burn-out: 
	- Boundaries and taking care of each other
	- Some of the work is on us to say no and others to be receptive 
	- We learn what's fair by having conversations
	- We are praised in our society for doing as much as possible
	- Many of us don't know what our capacities are because we keep working in burn out.

#### Giving Mutual Aid and How do you start
- started through instagram conversations
- friends in their network were having a rough time offered assistance or posting a mutual aid for them on Instagrm (or finding someone else to do iton their behalf)
- Offer, not just wait for people to ask.
- Mutual aid is not limited to Instagram, it's just a way to reach the masses. there are lots of other ways to do Mutual aid
- White friends to help with hospital visits, friends to give out care packages, art of auctions and raffles. service you can offer folks. Bartering instead of asking for money. Trade for service to make it more accessible. 
- REach out to people who post mutual aid. 
- Offer and ask for help in implementing

- if you have white privilege, use it to help normalize mutual aid
- Working together will get more done and help us retain our capacity

- monetary contributions should be only what they can. Small is relative and it's all helpful. 

##### Scarcity Mentality
- There are a lot of reasons we think this way (either chronically living that way or the way that the world appears to us)
- It's a dangerous mindset to have because it makes us hoard our resources
- The world is abundant and becomes moreso when w share with each other
- Capitalism perpetuates this

#### Receiving Mutual Aid (Asking for help)
- Societal conditioning makes this hard
- when we're vulnerable we can help support the community and strengthen trust
- People feel they don't deserve it, peope need it more, they're embrarssed. 
- It is really encouraging to get support. 
- Receiving mutual aid lets you know that you can depend on your community

#### Off of Instagram?
- Message Board (Physical location)
- The Community Garden has a newsletter that goes out via an email
	- The newsletter includes current mutual aid
- Message boards on Venus Envy
- Local Community work
	- Go to local gatherings to connect to folks locally to see face to face to see what folks need

#### Discussion
- What is your experience with mutual aid?
	- Sometimes people feel the need to over explain
		- Community trust is foundational to the surpport,
		- It's important to give each other th agency to help themselves rather than control that
	- It can be scary to reveal to the wider public that you need help.
		- Normalizing it is a way to stop people from being judgemental
	- Practicing asking for help in daily lives will make it normalized and a more reciprocal practice
	- Be intentional about things. Even if there's no need for things atm. But if there is anyway someone can help, let them know. 
	- Scarcity mindset also impacts the perception that "someone needs it more than me
		- If you need help you need help. SO ask for it. 
- How do we ensure agency to those receiving mutual aid?
	- "inviting them to lead the process, asking them their preferences around identifiability/anonymity, checking in, getting clear about their exact requests… validating and reassuring them throughout"- Dani
	- I've really been hearing so far this evening that its important to check and mobilize our privileges, as the folks supporting those receiving mutual aid.  I agree with Dani and Alex's shares: show-up, ask, listen, offer, follow-thru. - Juliana
	- I think validating and also not making it a big deal, normalizing it. And make it clear what you can offer so someone doesn’t have to wonder if what they’re asking is something you (the group/whoever) can give, to help alleviate that burden - Alex
	- Steering clear of all the expectations that come with the charity model as discussed earlier. 
	- Personally I try to ensure that I validate their experiences. When there feels appropriate, I've also had discussions about how community care is a value, and those of us who hold that value want to live true to that - so it's not a burden to build community connection, it's living our authentic selves - Clark
- How does Mutual aid manifest in your life right now? What's your dream for the future?

If no one has any responses, I have a question: 
Do you have tips for balancing the positive feeling of doing others/helping out with the pitfalls you mentioned earlier (saviourism/charity model/perfectionism), either within ourselves or when describing to others? I have some ideas but would love your perspective. 
- I think it’s good that it feels good, maybe focusing on that you’re contributing to a community / living values you care about rather than just about giving money or support to an individual. And also that asking for help is part of that too, so celebrating people feeling open and supported in community to ask for help, which allows us to lean on each other
- I think it feels good to give even without others seeing it/knowing it (beyond the person receiving), because its so important to help simply because we are human here to help each other, not because we want some recognition or to feed that saviour complex. I think those positive feelings come from fulfilling that value of community care 💜
