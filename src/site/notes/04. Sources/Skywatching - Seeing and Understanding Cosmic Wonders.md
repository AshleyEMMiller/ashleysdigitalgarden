# Highlights and Captures
## Lecture # 1 - Day and Night Skies across distances 
LectureDate:: 

### Introduction
- Skywatching encompasses the sky at a vast range of distances
- Rainbows are nearby, and Andromeda is 15 billion-billion miles, Comets are 100 million miles away, stars are a few hundred trillion miles away, meteors occur in the supper atmosphere, twilight sky is from the light in the atmosphere a few miles away

### Defining our Terms
- **Celestial Sphere** rotates around us 
	- **Zenith** - the highest point of the sphere in the middle
	- **Horizon** - where the celestial sphere meets the ground. Divides the sphere into above and below
		- **Tangent** to the earth, that barely touches it in the direction we're looking. The greater the height the the more distant the horizon
>[!idea] Geometry and Right Angle Triangles (?)
>- The greater the height (H) the more distant the horizon (D). The ground is a curve, but from our scales, the curve is negligible

>[!note] Formula
>d(miles) = 1.2 x squareroot h (feet)

- Mountains 
- The celestial sphere is ininitely far compared to the horizon
- The Celestial sphere seems flattened and it looks flattened especially with clouds

#### Blue Sky
- The atomosphere is about 60 miles thick, 3/4 of the atmosphere is within 6 miles
	- The earth is 4,000 miles
	- The atmosphere would be as thick as the rubber of a balloon
- **Troposphere**
	- Clouds
	- Airplanes and condensation trails
	- Rainbows
	- Solar Halos and Lunar Caron
	- Sunlight and water/ice interactions
- **Stratosphere**
- **Ozone**
	- Protects from UV
- **Mesosphere**
	- Shooting stars
	- Noctaluscent clouds that reflect light from the set sun, they're so high (50 miles up)
- **Ionosphere**
	- Magnetic fields
	- Norther and Southern Lights
	- Hubble Telescope
- A few earth diamters if GPS s a few earth Radii

- **The Moon** 
	- 60 earth radii, 240,000 miles away

**The Sun**
- 93 million miles or 24,000 Earth Radii
	- **astronomical units** (AU)
- 1 million earths could fit in the sun
- 390 moons across
- ==The sun is 390 times further from us than the moon than is from is us==
	- You need the same ratio of distance and sizes to get a perfect eclipse.
	- Ping pong ball and tennis ball demonstration (tennis ball is 2x size of ping pong ball and when they are exactly 2x the distance it works perfectly
	- They also need to be colinear (i.e. aligned perfectly) or you get a partial eclipse
>[!idea] Activity
>- Yard ruler and balls of different sizes, what distances do you need to place the  smaller object to eclipse the bigger object and what is the relationship  between those sizes and distances. 
>- The sun is 390 times the size of the moon and 390 times further away from us. 

### The planets
- They're a few AUs from us 
- **Venus** is called the Evening and Morning Star because
- **Jupiter** is another visible star though not as bright
	- 1000 earths could fit inside of it
- The planets move around around the Sky
- **Zodiacal Constellations**
	- The planets move through the stars throughout the night whereas the other stars stay in relative place. 

### The Stars
- They're distant suns and they look faint
- **Alpha Centauri** is our closest is 270,000 AU away (25 trillion miles)
	- Gravitationally bound system of three stars
>[!info] Distances are hard to fathom
>- If we condensed the earth to the size of a period, Proxima Centaur would be 1,000 miles away (San Fran to Denver)

- **Sirius**
	- 2x further than Alpha Centauri in **Canis Major** (dog star)
	- One of the brightest stars in the sky
- **Betelgeuse**
	- Orion's Shoulder
	- 150x further than Alpha centuri
- Most of the brightest stars in the sky are not nearby
- Of the ten closes stars/star systems only three are visible to the naked eyes
- The apparent brightness of a star is a combination of distance and luminosity (power/wattage)
- **Inverse square law of light**
	- A given amount of light spreads out over ever bigger spheres, each layer gets a more and more diffused light
>[!Activity] Inverse Square Law
>- Spray bottle
>	- The closer your spray the smaller the area but the more intesne the spritz
>	- The further away you spray the bigger the area but the lower the density
- To be bright the a star must be either verybright or very close
- The most common stars are actually very low power and so we can't see them easily. 

**Light Years**
- is a better way to give distances 
- even AUs is too small
- 186,000 miles/second divided by Year(seconds)
- ==6 trillion miles or 10 trillion km==

Light Years as a unit leads to a time travel component
- We can see the sun in the past 8.3 minutes behind 
- The moon is 1.3 light seconds away

>[!lol] Shoot for the moon, even if you miss, you'll land among the stars
>- so inaccurate to the relative distances of celestial objects

**Polaris**
- 430 light years away at the end of the little dipper
- It's not the brightest star, number 50
- But it's our current pole star, i.e. an extension of our north pole onto the celestial sphere

- Getting accurate distances of stars can be difficult
- Faint stars fill the night sky, our unaided eyes can see so many stars

- **V762**
	- Near Casseiopeia
	- 16,000 LY
	- Biggest distance for a naked eye visible

- Tycho Brahe (adnish astronomer)
	- Observed a stellar explosion visible during the day and brighter than venus

- **Super Nova Remnant**
	- The heavy elements like calcium and iron were produced by exploding stars, blasted into the universe and condensed in our solar system
>[!quote] We are made of star stuff
>- Carl Sagan

- **Nebulae** 
	- Condensed remnants that collapse and form stars and planets
- **Open Star Clusters**
	- End result of a collapsed nebula
	- A few hundred to a feew thousand stars with irregular shape

#### Galaxies
- Some are so luminous thatw e can see them
- The Magilenic Clouds
	- Drawf galaxies satelites of our Milky Way that may eventually be subsumed
- **Andromeda**
	- Light we see left 2.5 million years ago
>[!quote] The finite speed of light provides a movie of a history of the universe
>- Instructor

- **Gamma Ray Burst**
	- Sveral billion light years away
	- Special death of a star
	- Powerful jets of matter and radiation happen to point in our direction like a laser pointer

## Lecture # 8 - The Moon, Phases and Lunar Eclipses 
LectureDate:: 

### Agenda

### Content

#### The Moon
- Nearest natural celestial neighbour
- 1/4 of our diameter
- 240000 miles away, 60 earth radii
- The relative distance of the moon is what makes it seem like it's following us. 
	- The moon is so far away that it doesn't move much when compared to the distancees that we travel
	- Think of the video wherewhen traveling closeobjects pass quickly, medium distance objects pass slowly and distant objects don't move at all
	- So the moon looks like it's in the same place no matter where we are

- People see all sorts of things when looking at the moon:  face, a rabbit
>[!quote] Lunar rorchsack test
- Large Craters Visible and Maria (lava flows)
	- Lots of parts of the moon (see images/screen shots)
- The full moon looks lovely but washed out because the sun is shining directly over top of it
- Half moons are much more interesting because the sun's light is at an angle and it shows more geography
>[!idea] Look at the shadows of a surface from top light and edge lighting to show how the full moon is blown out versus half-moon
- **Terminator** boundary between ligh and dark, the sunrise/sunset on the moon and the longest shadows

##### Phases
- The same geography is visible regardles of the phase of the moon
- We always see the same face of the moon
	- The moon rotates at the same rate that it orbits the earth
	- I.e. 1/4 revolution corresponds to half a rotation
- **Synchronous Rotation** it orbits at the same rate that it rotates
	- **Tidal Forces** locked the moons initially asynchornous (and faster) rotation reltaive to the orbit
- But we don't see exactly the same face at the same time.
	- **Libration** - the moon wobbles over the course of a month
	- The moon's orbit isn't exactly crcilar so the orbital speed changes: it moves faster when near the earth than when further away. 
	- The moon's orbital speef varies with time but the rotation does not, then the orbit and rotation are not perfectly synchronous
	- Overall **librations** allow us to see 59% of the Moon's surface across the month

##### Lunar Phases
- New Moon: Unseen except during a solar eclipse
- Waxing Crescent
- First Quarter Moon - one week after new moon
- Waxing Gibbous
- Full Moon - One week after first quarter
- Waning Gibbous - it's getting less lit u
- Third Quarter - about a week after the full moon
- Waning Crescent 
- New Moon

- This takes 29 1/2 days to orbit the earth/Lunar Cycle
	- Gregorian Calendar does not align

- The Cause of the phases
	- The moon shines only by reflecting sunlight. So the hemisphere that's lit up is visible
	- But what we see depends on the relative positions of the sun moon and earth
	- **Geometric Relationship** Changes over the source of the orbit
	- There is no perpetually dark side of he moon, there is a perpetual "far side"
- The time of night/day that a lunar phase is visible
	- the moon can be visible when the sun is up, but the contrast is greater at night
	- Earth rotates counter clockwise and so throughout the phases the moon will be directly overhead at different times of the day.  
		- Using the Waxing Crescent as an example (see image) it will be overhead at 3 pm, in the western sky at 6 pm and setting at 9 pm (from the Equator) and the crescent moon rises at 9 am and so it's not in the sky from 9:00 pm to 9:00 am
	- We can get information when the moon is visible during 
		- If the moon is set, then it can be a good day/time to look at faint astronomical objects
		- The full moon is opposite the sun and will be up all night so it will wash out the sky and make it hard to see faint objects
>[!idea] Fun fact: Astronomers can be credible witnesses by using the moonrise and moonset timing and phases. If someone says they saw something during bright moonlight but the moon could not have been up at that time, their testimony is suspect
>- A mystery story using this as evidence for Story Club. Something short and fun/interesting.

- It's possible to see the very yougn crescent moon just a day after new moon - It's barely visible, but 
- The dark side is faintly lit up and you can see the maria
- **Earth Shine** when we see the crescent moon, the arth is gibbous from the surface of the earth If the earth reflects a lot of sunlight at the moon, it will be reflected by the moons surface and we can see the "dark side"
	- Earth shine decreases as the moon continues through its phases because as the moon waxes for us, we wane from the perspective of the moon's surface
- The Full Moon is actually much brighter than the other phases because the light hits it dead on and reflects dead on. Unlike in the ther phases where dust and structure scatter light that hits at an angle during different phases.
	- This has to do with the bumpy geography of the moon
- the Moon rotates throguhout the night and the terminator changes it's angle throughout the night (See images)
	- This is not related to the physical rotations
	- It is caused because we're viewing the moon from a spherical spinning earth
	- The terminator goes from parallel to the horizon, perpendicular and thenhorizontal 

- the moon rises in the east and sets in the west

- The sun's maximum height throughout the year
	- The sun is high in the summer and low int he winter and middling at the equinox. More obvious to those far from the
- The new moon is in the same direction as the sun and so it will have the same height in the sky as the sun (High in the summer and low in the winter) (The Sun's path is called the **Ecliptic**)
- The full moon will be "behind" the earth and so the closest hemisphere (because of the tilted axis) makes it have an opposite height int he sky than the new moon. Above or below the **Celestial Equator**
	- So If the New Moon is High in the Sky in the Summer, the Full moon will be low in the sky in the summer
	- If the New Moon is low in the sky in the winter, the full moon will be high in the sky in the winter
- **Belt of Venus** the twighlight sky just above earth's shadow

#### The Angle of the Ecliptic
- The Ecliptic makes a steep angle relative to the horizon at sunset. 
- Waxing crescent moon looks like a tilted bowl relative to the horizon
- The steep ecliptic makes the spring moon the best time to look at the sky
- In autumn the ecliptic is shallowest
- The moon is quite the opposite in the nrothern versus southern hermipshers

- Harvest moon: 
	- The full or nearly full moon rises slightly later on a few times which means that tiwlight is brighter allowing farmers to work a bit later
	- Astronomical bodies move in the same direction to the celestial equator (parallel) rise in the east
	- During the autumnal equinox the ecliptic is at a shallow angle and so the moon is close to the horizon and so it rises a little later each night and relfecting the sun's light it adds even brighter light to twilight
	- During the Sping, the ecliptic is almost perpendicular to the horizon and so the moon is further away from the horizon at around the same time. 

- Why does the moon look so large at the horizon (Particularly when full)?
	- The moon's orbit eliptical
	- At its closest the moon is 12% closer than when it's furthest and it looks 12% bigger at **angular size**. Apparent size in the sky
	- It is not always at the same time as the full moon
	- 12% doesn't look like a lot
	- The variations occur over the course of two weeks
	- The moon's angular size is smaller when rising and setting relative to when it is directly overhead. 
	- **Refraction** accounts for why the moon/sun look squashed when at the horizon compared to overhead. Vertical size is different

**Moon Illusion** is the result of likely several psychological effects
- Unlikly proposal was that at the horizon we can more easily compare the moon with known objects like buildings and it appears bigger, but this effect occurs even over open water, so not likely. 
- Flattened dome appearance of the **celestial sphere**
	- The sky looks further away at the **horizon** than at the **zenith** (oberhead)
	- So our brains overcompensate  when judging the apparent size of an object that has a constant physical size and a constant physical distance
	- Counter argument is that **Ponzo Illusion**: 
		- Paralell lines that converg our brains spread them out to make them look parallel and it's w
- Maybe the moon is a **Ponzo Illustion** where clouts and distant objects converge and our brains try to compensate
- The sun is the same, but we we don't look directly at usually
- Our eyes and perception systems are easily fooled by illusions

#### Lunar Eclipses
The moon goes into the Earth's shadow
- The moon's orbit is 5* off from the Earth and so oten the full moon falls outside of the Earth's Shadow
- When the moon falls within the 
- The partial phase can last up to an hour
- Total lunar eclipse is blood red
- The moon looks far more spherical at totality during 
- Most of the sunlight gets blocked by the earth, but some passes through the atmosphere and bnt towards the moon and reflects off the moon's surface to us. The blues, greens and violets get scattered ans o only yellow, organce and red light continue on their straight path
- This is why the organce and red light of sunlight (blue, violet and green) get scattered
- From the moon's point of view, the surface as a total solar eclipse
- The edge of the shadow gets more light than the centre
- If it passes through the edge of the shadow, 
- Earths shadow is circular, across a lunar eclipse. 
>[!idea] Activity: How can we know the earth is round?
>-  Only spheres cast a circular shadow no matter where the light hits from. A flat object cannot past a circular shadow in all directions.

- A tripod is best for lunar eclipses for long exposure
- Totality can last an hour
- [ ] When is the lunar eclipse, date and time of day?

>[!idea] Activity: Detect the early stages of the umbra touching 

The moon can experience a partial "solar eclipse". Only part of thensun is blocked from the perspective o the moon and it can be very very subtle dimming. 
Partial eclipses are common, a few tiems a year
Lunar Eclipses happen once every 1.5 years
Lunar eclipses are visibel fro the entire nighttime side of the earth

## Lecture # 10 - Observing Solar Activity and the Earth's Aurora 
LectureDate:: 

### Agenda

### Content
#### The Sun's Structure
- **Photosphere** is the disc or surface - photos of light emerge
	- **Sunspots** appear here
- **Chromosphere** thin pink/reddish which is warmer
- **Corona** extermely hot which flows out to form solar winds of energetic charged particles
- **Prominences** powerful outburst contributes to the solar wind
- **Flare** powerful outburst contributes to the solar wind
- **Coronal Mass Ejection** powerful outburst contributes to the solar wind
- **Solar Wind** reaches earth and leads to **Auroras** (more prominent during coronal mass ejections and flares)

##### Photosphere
- Visible surface, lowest level of atmosphere
- 1million miles across (109 earth diameters)
- 5800 kelvins (10,000 F)
- The surface is defined with sharp edge but no art surface, it's all gas (mosltion ionized as plasma)
- Photosphere is where the atmosphere is thin enough for photos to escape into space
	- The light is otherwise trapped by the dense gas
	- Nuclear reactions in the centre of the sun create the light, but it takes 100,000 years to reach the phosophere
	- It's bounced around in the hot opaque plasma


- Shade 14 welders glass
- Don't stare at the sun for more than a few minutes at a time even with eclipse glasses

- **Limb Darkening** The sun looks darker at the edge than closer to the middle. 
	- Near the edge you see light from cooler darker gas that's further from the sun's centre
- **Sun Spots** are dark blotches on the photopshere
	- People used to think that sunspots were holes that creatures could peer our
	- They're relatively cool spots (2/3 as warm) and they emit 1/5-1/4 as much energy as their surroundings
	- If you immersed a sunspot into dark space it would glow quite brightly. 
	- Sunspots are regions where the sun's magnetic fields are tangled and slow the photos as they try to get out. So what's there escapes, but is not quickly replenshed by what's inside
	- Sunspots can be larger than the earth
>[!idea] Activity or concept: Relative Brightness
>- Sunspots are dark compared to the neighbouring photosphere, but compared to the darkness of space they do glow 
>

- Large sunspots can be viewed through pinhole cameras
- The bigger the hole, the brither the image, but the less focused
- To get a sharp image you need a small hole but it won't be magnified
>[!idea] Sunspotter
>- used to observe the rotation of the sun by watching sun spots rotate over the surface
>- You can draw the sun spots

>[!idea] Solar Observations can help to track sunspots
>- SOHO
>- Solar Dynamics Observatory
>- Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE)

Do not use a telescope with folter on the eyepiece

Obsering the sun can get young people interested in science 

#### Chromosphere
- This is very thin, only the diameter of theEarth
- Colourful (chromo)
- You can't see it  during the day because he sun is so bright
- Twice as hot as the photosphere
	- Not sure why 
	- Maybe mechanical heating because of pressure waves?
	- Energy released from magntici fielcds?
- Red/Pink because hot neutral hydrogen atoms glow with the colour - it has to do with the electrons going up and down to orbits **H alpha**

#### Corona
- Thinner outer atmosphere of the sun
- Fainter than the day time sky so usually not visible
- Visible during a total solar eclipse
- Delicate strucutre is from charge particles in the plasm that flow along the magnietic field around the sun
- The magnietic field is radial, but with some
- The corona a few million degrees farenheit so very fast particles and so the density is so low that the corona is faint
- If  you immerse yourself in the corona (with a shield) you'd freeze to death
	- The particles are heating you but the rate is slow and you'd cool faster thn gain heat in this million degree gas
- The heat may have to due with **magnetic energy**
- And it's so how and so it's ionized
- In the ultraviolet wave lengths you can see ionized gasses
	- Blue is iron ions
	- yellow is 3 million degrees
	- Red Iron ionized 13 times 1.4 millions degrees 

#### Solar Wind
- the faded Corona that streams from the sun through empt space
- The outer extension of the corona
- 600 miles/second
- They intteract with planetary fields
- They push the gasses fo comet tails

#### Solar Prominences
- Eruptions of gas from the sun surface and chromosphere
- They are red or pink
- Some of the gas is ionized following magnetic fields flowing from minutes to days
- Pink is H-alpha
- H-alpha filter is good for watching prominences becasue it only permits red light on a telescooe

#### Solar Flares and Coronal Mass Ejections
- Solar Flares are extremely energetic eruptions from small local regions of the sun (10 million degrees farenheit)
- Flares occur at strong tangled magntic fileds like rubber hands stretched around your hands, evntually they snap and quickly release a lotfo energy
- It's a release of **magnetic energy** which leads to **magnetic reconnection** which destroys matnig fields and using their energy to eject particles as high speed

##### Coronal Mass Ejections
- spread out over large area
- A major portion of the corona sppears to shoot out of the sun with lots of charged particles
- It's ike a hurricane where a flare is a lightening strike
- They may be related to/cauused by solar flares, but sometimes not
- **Occulting Disc** blocks out the sun's disc to get a better look at the fainter corona

#### Hazards
- High energy particles can be hazardous to astronauts
- Unmanned spacecraft can be disrupted 
- **Geomagnetic Storms** can blow out power on the earth's surface
	- 1989 - Quebec transformers were fried by electrical currents and lead to power outages across lots of Canada
	- 1859 - Largest event in history. Flare and coronal mass ejection leadd to intense auroral displays. Charged particles disrupted the telegraph systems
	- If we experienced something like this today it would be calamatous. 
		- Bigger flares are less likely and a monstrous one aimed at us would be likely every century or millenium
		- The way to manage is to shut down power when we know that a massive stream is headed out way. 
		- We need to shield important components
- **Space Weather** is a growing area of interest

### Solar Cycles
- There is a ~11 year cycle of sun spots
- At the minimum there maybeb few if any
- But at maximum there can be many
- They form at high latitudes and migrate to lower latitudes as the cycle progresses
- Flares, Coronal Mass Ejectiosna d Prominence cycle with the sun spot cycle. 
- The sun's magnetic field changes with time and the corona shape changes with different eclipses: 
	- Right before the sun spot maximum (e.g.  August 1999) complex but symmetric with streams going in different directions
	- Solar minumum (e.t. March 2006, and august 2008)  the streams centre on the sun's equator
		- July 2009 - equatorial streamers with polar brush tufts
		- Jul 2010 streamers in many directions
- The cuase of the solar activity cycle is not fully understood
- It's a complex system with magnetics and nuclear energy and everything ellse
- At first approximation the sun's magnetic field is like a bar magnet  With a nort and south pole, but every eleven or so years, the poles flip and switch places during solar mimum
	- Similar to the reversal of the earth's magnetic field which is irregularly but happens every ~300,000 years. We don't know what causes earth's reversals

>[!idea] Why it's important to study and observe the sun
>- early warning for flares and coronal mass ejections that could have power grid issues

### Aurora Borealis and Australis
- Northern and Southern lights
- Charged particles in the solar wind get trapped by the earth's magntic field and so they spiral around them and guided along them
- Particles are found in the van allen belts which are far from the earth's surface in most places except at the poles
- The kinetic energy in the atmosphere results in ionization and it drops back down 
- Partial conversion of movement energy into light
- Aurora are formed at higher altitudes than clouds
- Solar winds interact with the Earth's magnetic field to squash the side closes to the sun and the backside gets blown out to longer loops
- Glory around an airplanes shadow
- Auuroras don't often occure at the pole because of the way the magnetic fields land
- Canada gets Auroras more than Europe and Asia
- Auroras can still be visible during times of weak solar activity, but they're most active when flares and coronal mass ejections 
- They supply new particles to the atmosphere
- Auroras are best during the solar maximum and auroras could be visible at temperate latitudes
- Aurora Australis
	- Is less visible, the best visibility is over the ocean
	- Astronauts get to see the aurora from space
	-

LectureDate:: 

### Agenda

### Content
- Solar winds and the corona lead to arora and power surges. 
- Air molecules scatter the light and make it hard for us to see the corona on earth
- When the Total Eclipse happens the Corona is visible in a "ghostly" view
- Solar Eclipses have an anthropolgical history of being a bad omen
- The cultural 
	- The sun and the moon make love (hide in darkness)
	- The sun feels neglected, angry sad or sick
	- The sun and the moon are having a lovers spat
	- 
- The beauty and graduer  are not iminshed by the dry scientific explanation
- The sun is 390x the size of the moon, it's 390x further away. it can take up the same amount of space in the sky (i.e. 0.5 degree) - subtend
- There is no reason, the moon is drifting away,
	- Eclipses are becoming shorte and rarer with time

- Why doesn't a solar eclipse happen every month?
	- The moon's orbital plane it tilted by 5* and so the new moon is just above or below the earth
	- Sometimes they all aling (colinear)
		- Each year there are 7 solar eclipses and lunar eclipses (partial)
		- Total Eclipse are every 1.5 years (similar to total luna eclipses)
- 

### The Stages of A Total Solar Eclipse
1. Moon orbits year moving west to east, it first starts to cover the western side of the sun (First Contact)
2. Eventually a sizeable chunk has been bitten out of the sun. We're seeing a **silhouette** of the moon. 
3. More of the sun is covered but the sky remains bright
4. >50% coverage leads to a drop in light intensity
	1. Our eyesadjust adjust to the slowly dimming light
5. ~75% the sky darkens noticeable
6. 9
7. The final coverage appears rapid
8. **Diamond Ring** effect, is the last light of the sun is like a diamond compared to the darkening sky. The **corona** is faintly visible
9. The pink **chromosphere** is visible
10. **Bailey Beads**
11. **Second Contact** the eclipse is total (No photosphere will be visible)
	1. The suns **corona** will be visible



The light in the sun's corona is far too small to harm you. 
A total eclipse cannot damage your eyes, only partial phases
The diamond ring can be viewed witht he naked eye and 2-3 seconds after totality after the second diamond ring
	Don't look at the diamong ring throug binoculars or telescopes because of the concentrating effect

Parts of the Sun
- Chromsphere: The thin hot layer outside the photosphere
- Corona: millions of degrees it is faint and barely visible
	- Photos are tricky (and overexposure is likely to get fain t bits), but the human eye has a great dynamic range to see a range of brightness. 
	- Delicate streaming
		- Hairbrush patterns in the polar regions. 
	- Some people will dark adjust their eyes to make them better able to see the eclipse

- A total eclipse sun looks like a black hole int he sky
	- Wide Angle Painting by John Booens 
- Earthshine is visible and the moon can be iluminated. From the Moon's perspective the Earth is full and it is illuminated. You cannot see it by eye. You need to see it with a tool. 
	- The corona is too bright
	- You can look at the moon with a straw
- The moon's shadow is also visible during totality
- The shadow is a cylinder, but because of perspective it looks like a cone. The shadow is most visible in open
- The shadow can be seen approaching from the west if you have a clear horizon
- You can twilight sky 360*
	- Light from places outside of the total eclipse tilfering through and thebluest rays get scattered, so orange and yellow dominate
- Away from the horizon the sky is darker and you can see the brightest objects in the sky
	- Find a sky chart before the eclipse

12. Second **Diamond Ring** begins after the end of totality. The partial dark adaptation makes the second  ring particularly beautiful
	1. It's wider because of **Bailey's Beads** because the moon's surface is uneven, mountains, craters and geography
	2. **Librations** the moons visible edge changes with time and some parts 
13. Clouds can add to the drama
	1. Some clouds can create **obvious irridescence**
14. **Shadow Bands** very subtle and obvious when there is a thin sliver and without cloudd cover. For a few minutes before or after totality there can be faint dark and light ripples shimmering across the surface
	1. Analogous to rippled of light in a shallow pool of water.  Caused by atmospheric turbulence that is the same stuff that makes stars twinkle. But the sun is so bright that we can see where it appears to be darker and lighter than usual.

>[!quote] Lunatic if you'll pardon the puns

- Sensory and emotional overload
- Animals start behaving weirdly (e.g. roosters will)

>[!idea] Activity
>- Shadows perpendicular to the thin part of the crescent will get sharper
>- Fingers spread apart in one direction will be sharper than another direction. Because the rays are coming from a narrower range one way than the other

### Locations where a total eclipse is visible
- The moon's shadow is only 150 miles at best and less than 100 miles usually
- As the moon orbits the earth the shadow traces from West to East, it's the direction for the direction that earth rottats and compensates for the speed of the shadows movement
	- The shadow moves a few thousand miles an hour
- The theorhetical maximum is 7.5 mins but eclipses greater than 6 minutes are rare
- **Centre Line** is where totality is longest
- Totality is shorter if you're near the beginnign or end of the long path
- The shadow moves across the earth's spherical  surface it looks curved when mapped on a flat map
- Areas in the poles exaggerated because the moon's shadow is a bit wider due to the shadow being tangent. The cone of darkness spreads out in the poles
- The partial eclipse can last from a few minutes to a few hours
- Is there are thin cirrus or stratocirrus claouds to create irridescence
- Shadows of objects get sharper as more of the sun get eclipsed in the direction perpendicular to the thin part of the crescent
	- Imagine the crescent in horizontal
	- The smaller range of directions (vertical) so the shadows are sharper. 
	- When the diamond ring happens you can see shadows from individual haris because the light is so focused
- Viewing: 
	- Shade 14 glass 
	- Pinhole camera on a shaded piece of paper
	- The ground under trees will create a pinhole camera that projects the sun's image
	- Small unfiltered telescope of the sun and project onto shadows
	- Pair of binoculars 

### Annular Eclipse
- The sun is not fully eclipsed (the photosphere is visible)
- The moon's orbit is an elipse 
- The earth is off-centre by 6%
	- The moon is 12% closest at certain points than when it's furthest and so it looks bigger
	- **Eccentricity** of the orbit can exceed 12% and the angular size can vary
- If the Moon is further away it can appear smaller than the sun and so it leaves a ring of **photosphere**
- Earth's orbit around the sun is also eliptical so the Sun looks bigger and smaller depending on the earth's distance.
- Annular eclipses are slightly more frequent
- But it;s still interesting: 
	- Beginning and end you can see some prominences or even a corona on the side of the sun that's barely covered.


#### Hybrid Locations: 
- in parts of the world in the middle of the path (where the earth's surface bulges out) the moon appears big enough for a total eclipse. But parts at the begining and Moon is further and so the shadow is smaller
- Hybrid eclipses are great for Baileys Beads and visual chromosphere and prominences

#### Geography of Totality
- Not much of the earth's surface experiences totaltu
- On average an eclipse occurs once per 400 years in a single location
