- <mark class="hltr-orange">Instead of blindly cranking tasks, mindframing is about creating growth loops with constant feedback so you can be mindful of the way you achieve your goals.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=4I92VQ3V) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">There’s no point getting something done if you damage your mental health in the process. There’s also no point getting something done if this was not the right thing to spend your energy on in the Trst place.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=KKHJAMZ7) 
 
## Developing the right mind frames

- <mark class="hltr-grey">The focus of this article will be on the PARI system, which is a practical approach to apply mindframing from the way you work to the way you learn.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=6N8DM2Q8)

## Turning goals into growth loops with the PARI system

- <mark class="hltr-blue">As James Clear put it: “Systems are for people who care about winning repeatedly. Goals are for people who care about winning once.” But a system without goals is like running a marathon without a Tnish line.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=2B992HCG) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">In reality, goals and systems work together. And in order for a productivity system to work, goals need to be simple and repeatable. This way, they will create a constant feedback loop which will foster the right mind frames</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=67YMR7SF) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">The right productivity system produces an unstoppable virtuous circle.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=SUR9F7RW)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">simple and repeatable activities that will bring you closer to achieving your goal and will progressively help you develop your growth mindset.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=YNTUGCU3)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Instead of just blindly repeating the same activity every day, it’s important to make time for self-reUection in order to consolidate what you learn and to adapt in case your approach is not working.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=BEJ3HN9J) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">There are several ways to go about it</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=3HYBG93B) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">The medium doesn’t really matter.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=JLVR4J69) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">What matters is that you produce content that will serve both as a repository for your thought process and a way to reUect on your experience.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=RQ9P54BK) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Of course it can be daunting to publicly share your thoughts, progress and challenges with the world, but this will ensure you’re not only being productive, but also mindfulof your productivity.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=SWVCU97W)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Once you feel closer to your goal, it’s time to work on something bigger that gets you out of your comfort zone.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=6B9MUA9V) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">the “impact” phase can be your North Star while you’re focused on the “act” and “pact” phases.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=9UT4X93I) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">This step will push you to do something you don’t quite yet feel comfortable to do. And that is exactly the point. If you have dedicated enough time to the Trst phases, you do have the means to achieve something bigger,</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=UDL4GSN4) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">If during the “react” phase you realise that something’s not working, you can go back to the previous phases to Tgure out what can be improved.</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=9FESWMFX) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">Sometimes it’s the way you implement your pact that’s not working, and you just need to try different strategies in the “act” phase</mark> [p1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FUQHS6EP?page=1&annotation=LP8HUAWR)
