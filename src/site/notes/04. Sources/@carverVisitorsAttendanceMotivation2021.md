# Tools and Activities
## VINES-themed wise intervention
Written or verbal prompts that encourage participants to make literal or metaphorical connections between themselves and the educational material/observable phenomenon. This can first spark [[Transformative Experiences\|Transformative Experiences]] or Self and content-focused engagement (on the VINES continuum) through [[Expanded Perception\|Expanded Perception]]. With further prompting, the learner can experience [[Perceived self-relevance\|Perceived self-relevance]] and focus on engaging with and reflecting on themselves.

## Introduction
While there is a lot of research about informal science learning at museums and science centres, there continues to be a gap in our understanding of how science-related events can foster public engagement with science. Science events (e.g. astronomical events, wildlife observations, etc.) are excellent opportunities for connecting diverse audiences with science through multiple entry points of social and personal relevance. However, the evaluations used at these kinds of events focus on attendance and demographics, science literacy or the didactic components. This research study aimed to fill this gap by examining meaning-making and the subjective experience, which has been broadly studied in museum settings. The study also aims to provide a low-cost/low-effort tool for event organizers to facilitate self-reflexive science engagement and meaning-making among attendees. The science event under study was an eclipse viewing and the authors note that while there is an over-abundance of resources on the educational and descriptive perspectives of an eclipse, there is a dearth in studies that explore how observers might make personal meaning from experiencing an eclipse. 

The authors define engagement as "psychological participation in the task at hand". They define meaning-making as "the interpretation an individual gives to their experience in order to create personal significance"; it is "personal, contextual, and occurs across time". 

They argue that their definition of engagement implies that focused attention is being paid and there are active cognitive and emotional proccesses taking place. However, engagement does not equate to meaning-making. Regardless of how it happens, engagement relies on prior knowledge and interest (i.e. relevance). 

Prior knowledge and expectations inform the visitors' motivations for attending museums and, by extension, science events. The purpose of a museum visit influences the engagement and what people take away from the experience (i.e. knowledge or memorable experiences).

The study had three goals: 
1. Use brief interventions to facilitate engagement in a science event
2. Apply existing museum visitor engagement and meaning-making frameworks to a public science event
3. Explore ways that engagement can inspire attendees to use the experience/information from an event for self-reflection

They addressed these goals with two research questions: 
1. What are visitors' motivations for attending a public, science-themed solar eclipse event?
2. What engagement is manifested when individuals are prompted by a VINES-based brief intervention?
## Theoretical Concepts
### üõ†Ô∏è Tool  - Wise Interventions
Wise interventions are brief social interactions or solo reflections to boost an individual's well-being by encouraging them to focus on internal processes like emotions, self-perceptions, beliefs, and motivation. Brief interventions could lead to disproportionate meaning-making from experiences and have demonstrated effects across educational and health areas. 

Research examples of successful wise/brief interventions are: 
- short written reflections about self-belief and academic motivation had positive effects for several years
- short written reflections about the connection between a science subject and personal experiences increased science interest

Wise interventions can allow researchers and educators to encourage learners to create and reflect on their personal connections and newly derived meanings of new information and experiences. 
### üî© Framework - Museum Identities

The researchers reference Falk's museums identities framework, which outlines seven motivations and corresponding identities associated with museum-goers. 
- Experience Seekers
- Facilitators
- Professionals/Hobbyists
- Explorers
- Community Seekers
- Respectful Pilgrims
- Rechargers

### üî© Framework - Experience Anticipation
Pekarik and others identified an additional classification for attendance motivations that focused on the types of experience museum-visitors were seeking. The team, after surveying visitors at nine Smithsonian museums identified the following anticipated experiences: 
- Object or Phenomenon Experiences
- Social Experiences
- Cognitive Experiences
- Introspective Experiences

### üî© Framework - Visitor Identification and Engagement with STEM (VINES)
VINES is a continuum that frames educational material as a launching point for visitors to learn more about STEM topics and about themselves. A visitor's attention will shift throughout an experience and the VINES framework codifies different entry points for engagement. VINES also allows for multiple outcomes: from an increased knowledge of a STEM concept to an awareness of how that concept relates to everyday life to a deeper understanding of themselves and their place in the world. 

The three main portions of the continuum are: 
1. Content-focused engagement
	- The cognitive and emotional focus is on the learning materials
2. Self and content-focused engagement (similar to [[Transformative Experiences\|Transformative Experiences]])
	- Educational material is used to spark a deeper more nuanced understanding of the world through an [[Expansion of Perception\|Expansion of Perception]] that allows them to make meaning
	- Can encourage learners to make unique and personalized connections with the educational material which leads to long-term interest.
3. Self-focused engagement
	1. The learner focuses on themselves, their identity, experiences, beliefs and traits. 
	2. Through [[Perceived self-relevance\|Perceived self-relevance]] the learner moves from focusing on both themselves and the content to [[Identity Exploration\|Identity Exploration]] (the learner reflects on their needs, wants, actions and roles).  

### üî© Framework - Self-Relevance of Educational Material
Hartwell and Kaplan outlined a multidimensional  framework for [[self-relevance\|self-relevance]] in formal education (their study focused on junior high students) that involves three dimensions (or "points of origin"): 
1.  The Academic Material
2. A bridge/relation between the material and the concept of self
3. The learners' interests, values, goals and beliefs etc. 

Leveraging this framework can support deeper understanding by providing learners with multiple personal personal connection points. 

## Methods
The study invited 85 adults to complete a short questionnaire (5-10 mins) while attending an eclipse-viewing event at a university campus in the USA prior to the eclipse. 79 responses were used in the study with most respondents between the ages of 18 to 29. Roughly two-thirds identified as female, approximately one third male and 5% did not disclose their gender. 

The study participants were asked the following prompts. 
1. Please tell us why you came to the event today, and what is it about the eclipse that is interesting to you? 
	- Participants encouraged to reflect on their motivations for attending
2. People in different places in the world may see no eclipse, a partial eclipse, or a full eclipse. Some travel far to see a total eclipse. Seeing a total eclipse is like being in the right place at the right time. How can you use this idea of an eclipse as an analogy to something in your own life? Please explain.
	- Being in the right place at the right time
3. During the total solar eclipse, the temperature is expected to drop 10‚Äì15 degrees Fahrenheit. What does this tell you about the sun‚Äôs rays? What are the sun‚Äôs rays exactly? What in your everyday life is like the sun‚Äôs rays? Please explain. 
	- The effect of eclipse both literally and metaphorically
4. A solar eclipse takes place when the Moon temporarily moves between the Sun and Earth. This event briefly allows us to see objects in our solar system differently. How might an eclipse, or the idea of an eclipse, relate to your life? Be creative and think of any connection that is meaningful to you.
	- Self-relevance reflection that uses the eclipse as a metaphor to reflect on personal experience

The responses were analyzed qualitatively by NVivo and coded at the sentence level.

## Findings
### Research Question 1 - What are visitors‚Äô motivations for attending a public, sciencethemed solar eclipse event? 
Attendees had different motivations but were all directly linked to the eclipse event. 

Over three-quarters of the respondents anticipated at least one experience similar to those outlined in Pekarik et al.'s Experience Anticipation model. Most wanted an Object/Phenomenon experience (i.e. to see the eclipse). Of those that did not anticipate an Object/Phenomenon experience half of them anticipated a Social Experience. One third anticipated an Introspective Experience and one-sixth anticipated a Cognitive Experience. One quarter anticipated more than one experience. 

95% of the respondents indicated attendance motivations in alignment with Falks' Museum Identities model. Three quarters indicated a single motivation with the remaining expressing multiple motivations for attending. Most respondents could be categorized as Experience Seekers, given the comments on the rarity and significance of the eclipse. Many people indicated that they were Facilitators. Many people responded that they wanted to share the experience with their families and friends. No responses were categorizes as falling into the Respectful Pilgrims or Rechargers groups (surprising no one). 

### Research Question 2 - what engagement is manifest when individuals are prompted by a VINES-based brief intervention? 
#### Content-Focused Engagement

Most of the participants provided content-focused responses, primarily to prompt three where the sun's importance to an eclipse was highlighted. 
#### Expanding Perception

Over three-quarters of participants provided responses that demonstrated connections between eclipse-related science and their everyday lives for prompt 2, 3, and 4. They used both literal and metaphorical connections to the eclipse. 

The authors note that the responses didn't indicate [[Transformative Experiences\|Transformative Experiences]] but did imply [[Expanded Perception\|Expanded Perception]]. 

In response to prompts 2 and 4, participants shared ideas that connected the eclipse to human experiences that were primarily metaphorical. There responses focused on being at the right place at the right time (e.g. romantic or professional opportunities), temporary experiences of loneliness. 

Prompt 4 generated variations on the metaphor of the moon passing in front of the sun relating to perspective-shifting experiences.

#### Self-Relevance
Most participants provided feedback that commented on their beliefs, attitudes and experiences. The first prompt (about motivation for attending) garnered over half of the self-focused statements and many times statements related to social role. 

Prompt 2 elicited a handful of eclipse-related analogies to personal experiences. Prompt three also resulted in personally relevant comparisons (e.g. the sun's rays are like their feelings towards their loved ones). Prompt four resulted in the remaining self-relevant statements that explicitly asked participants to connect the eclipse with their daily lives. 

The prompts that focused on science information generated very few self-relevant statements. 

#### Multiple foci of engagement
Prompt three sparked the most responses that indicated multiple engagement foci. 

## Broader Implications
The overlap between indiviual, social and topical motivations aligns with the concept of  [[self-relevance\|self-relevance]]. The motivations for attending did not limit participants abilities to reflect and create metaphorical connections with the eclipse and their personal experiences. This applied even to those who indicated a content-focused motivation for attending, which suggested that prompting can lead to unexpected kinds of engagement. 

Moreover, the fact that those with content f-focused motivations can reflect on the experience more personally demonstrates the movement between different types of engagement along the VINES continuum. It shows that participants initial motivations do not have to be the only entry point for fostering meaning-making.

Public science events can connect educational material/STEM phenomena  and self-relevance. Since the learning outcomes are more flexible than in a formal setting, they can foster novel ways of exploring subject matter. 

Public engagement with science does not need to rely solely in increasing content knowledge. Science events create a unique opportunity to invite attendees to create connections with science and their day-to-day lives for meaning-making. 

The study demonstrates that adults may be willing to reflect on a science experience/observation for deeper meaning-making when provided with brief prompts.

- Prompts that encourage participants to make literal or metaphorical connections between themselves and the educational material can spark [[Transformative Experiences\|Transformative Experiences]]/Self and content-focused engagement 

#### Limitations
- The event environment created barriers to recruitment, questionaire completion, and depth of engagement between the researchers and participants. 
- The sample size was more for convenience and generalizability should be taken witha  grain of salt. 
- The richness of the responses were a blessing and curse and meant that direct connections between responses and parts of the prompts could not be drawn. 
- The study did not evaluate attendees' understanding of the eclipse. 
- The lack of pre-test/post-test means that the study cannot make causal inferences. I.e. responses may have been influences by the intervention the researchers cannot say that the intervention "caused" by the VINES intervention.

### Opportunities for meaningful engagement during public science events [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=F36TC4UE) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-green">Each year, science events such as eclipse viewings, wildlife watches, meteor showers, and space launch or astronomy-themed activities reach millions of people around the world (Bultitude et al., 2011)</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=HFQ8UA6F) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Events connect large and diverse audiences to natural phenomena and scientific breakthroughs and have the potential to grow the public‚Äôs science understanding and appreciation by offering opportunities for conversations about its individual and societal meaning and relevance.</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=L3Z36IGR) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Unlike visitor studies in museum exhibition contexts, however, impact evaluations associated with public science events often focus on attendance demographics, specific aspects of public science literacy, or didactic objectives that overlook subjective, phenomenological meaning making (Bell et al., 2009; Bultitude & Sardo, 2012).</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=6N9VM62Y) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">One legacy of the large body of knowledge about museum visitors‚Äô diverse purposes for engagement and meaning making is the rationale it provides for exploring broad questions about the public‚Äôs motivation to engage with and assimilate science in various contexts, as this yields an opportunity to understand more about the ways in which subjective and personalized meaning making intersects with science learning (Dierking et al., 2003)</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=PPMNKVCA) 
 
#### Brief interventions [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=WE6D8T3M) 
 
- [ ] <mark class="hltr-red">The idea that even brief opportunities for reflection have the potential to increase engagement and alter the personal meaning ascribed to particular experiences is encapsulated in Walton‚Äôs(2014) concept of wise interventions, which employs short-term individual or inter-personal activities that target specific psychological mechanisms such as self-efficacy or motivation, with the aim to direct the person‚Äôs trajectory towards enhanced wellbeing.</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=IADR9Y4D) #ToDo/Read 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Wise or brief interventions have been shown to have substantial positive impacts in individuals‚Äô thinking in a variety of education and health domains (Yeager & Walton, 2011).</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=HABV55PB) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Walton and Cohen (2011) found that a brief writing reflection exercise improved minority students‚Äô self-beliefs and academic achievement motivation, with benefits persisting for several years</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=9EH5YHD4) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">In science learning, Hulleman and Harackiewicz (2009) found that a brief written reflection about the personal relevance of science positively impacted students‚Äô interest in the subject matter.</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=2NPI3K3W) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Brief interventions in social domains have also shown promise for soliciting and even changing self-perceptions, beliefs, and emotions, as well as feelings of inclusion or belonging within a particular community (Walton et al., 2015).</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=J5ICR59B) 
 
- [ ] <mark class="hltr-orange">They may offer researchers and practitioners a flexible tool through which in-depth consideration of content in relation to the self can be facilitated (Hartwell & Kaplan, 2018).</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=V7MMYUSU)  #ToDo/Read 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Another purpose was to build on visitor learning research that attends to the personalized nature of learning and engagement (Falk, 2009; Rennie & Johnston, 2004), including the widely acknowledged conclusion that learning in museum settings involves affective as well as cognitive processes and outcomes.</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=NN6A8ISW) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Specifically, we extend an already broad definition of learning through the application of a theoretical framework (Garner et al., 2016) that builds on the concept of museums as contexts for identity exploration (Rounds, 2006) and includes the self as a domain of learning.</mark> [p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=4&annotation=8344F7WD)

### Visitor engagement and meaning making  [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=P6UWCPF6) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">some scholars have linked specific observable behaviors with particular degrees and purposes of engagement (Barriault & Pearson, 2010), others have articulated definitions of engagement that focus on a spectrum of psychological processes encompassing cognitive and affective domains (Dierking & Falk, 1994), or broadened the indicators of engagement to include ‚Äòmental, physical, or social activity on the part of the learner‚Äô (Rennie & Johnston, 2004, p. S10)</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=X7QB73JJ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">in the present study we draw on works by Kaplan, Sinai, and Flum (2014) and Rahm (2012) to consider engagement as meaning psychological participation in the task at hand.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=A7PN4UL5) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">For our purposes, this was a brief writing task prior to or concurrent with the initial onset of the solar eclipse.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=6JYMTWGZ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">This definition of engagement assumes attention and the potential for cognitive and affective processes on the part of the respondent. It does not assume that engagement is sufficient for meaning making, which we define as the interpretation an individual gives to their experience in order to create personal significance (Bell et al., 2009; Rounds, 1999).</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=YTL9JVFM) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Meaning making, like learning, is personal, contextual, and occurs across time (Rennie & Johnston, 2004).</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=EAXSX82K) 
 
#### Attendance motivation [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=CFMNWJ7F) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Whatever the form engagement takes, scholars acknowledge that it is impacted by prior knowledge and interest.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=455X6WXM) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">These factors can influence attendance motivation and the information or impressions taken from a visit (Doering & Pekarik, 1999; Falk & Dierking, 2012).</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=B82YR8ZP) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">The work of Falk and colleagues (Bond & Falk, 2013; Falk, 2009) underscores the importance of visit purpose as an influential antecedent for engagement.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=TQ9KQJF4) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Falk‚Äôs research conceptualizes common, salient purposes as types of visitor identity that steer the individual towards or away from particular exhibition features.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=BHS8K9MI) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Experience Seekers are excited by the opportunity to witness an exhibition; Facilitators are looking to guide family members‚Äô or friends‚Äô experiences; Professionals/Hobbyists are attending due to an alignment with hobbies, interests, or personal object; Explorers have a desire to learn or experience something new; Community Seekers are looking for the company or presence of likeminded or similar individuals; Respectful Pilgrims desire to visit a significant artifact or location of cultural or historical significance; and Rechargers seek to take a break from daily life (Falk & Dierking, 2012)</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=2LPRNC3F) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">We examine the degree to which Falk‚Äôs categories might apply to a public science event, and, given the rarity and intergenerational nature of the event, use this framework to examine the possibility of multiple purposes for attending.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=3R8VDFK6) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">In an effort to understand what they might be seeking, other research on anticipatory aspects of engagement has asked visitors to articulate the types of experiences that are most satisfying. Pekarik et al. (1999) asked visitors at nine large North American museums to reflect on the sources of their most satisfying museum visits.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=4YT88JNT) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">They classified statements into Object or Phenomenon experiences, Social experiences, Cognitive experiences, and Introspective experiences.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=4N62AW4R) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Visitors were often excited and fulfilled by artifact or phenomenon-based experiences, the opportunity to experience museum content with family or friends, the chance to gain new understandings or information, and a location for reflection.</mark> [p5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=5&annotation=F44RQQML) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">Therefore, in addition to the goal of using a brief intervention approach as a scaffold for engagement, the present study sought to apply existing research to better understand sources of visitor motivation for attending a public science event.</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=64VSHLDZ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">A third goal was to examine the degree to which engagement, including cognitive, motivational, and affective processes might lead the individual to consider content as a point of leverage for reflecting on the self (Barriault & Pearson, 2010).</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=MQ9WERHQ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Following other scholars‚Äô suggestion that museum visitors may experience engagement as a dynamic process that reflects the subjective interaction among social, personal, and physical contexts (Falk & Dierking, 2012),</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=DFU8XATU) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">we propose that the focal point of engagement might not only shift during an event but might be malleable depending on the brief intervention prompt</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=T3RRW969) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">If so, researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance meaningful experiences among attendees might be able to select prompts and leverage the context to invite and sustain visitors‚Äô engagement.</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=5ZK4VCWK) 
 
#### A conceptual framework for visitor engagement [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=PCZWEWVX) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-green">To understand the various origins and outcomes of visitors‚Äô experiences, theoretical models must account for diversity in the origin and target of engagement as well as possibilities for shifts and multiplicities in the orientation of the visitors‚Äô attentional focus.</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=8VTLW4GL) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">One such model is VINES, which is an acronym for Visitor Identification and Engagement with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (Garner et al., 2016)</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=K4WNAL3C) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">In the VINES model, the focal point of visitors‚Äô psychological engagement is conceptualized as a dynamic continuum ranging between content- and self-focused engagement, with opportunities for multiple forms of engagement as visitors‚Äô attention shifts throughout a visit or an event.</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=GMFYXMMD) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Outcomes can range from increased learning about a phenomenon, to a changed understanding of the world in light of learning about the phenomenon, to a new understanding of the self and insights into one‚Äôs relation to the world.</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=ETUSHMRF) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">In other words, the VINES continuum depicts content as serving as an opportunity for exploration of the visitor‚Äôs concept of self as well as their concept of the scientific phenomena.</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=V24AAIQE) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">To illustrate, a visitor may begin their visit to a museum exhibition or public science event by focusing on content but then (spontaneously or after prompting) move towards thinking about how that content applies to other settings, how it helps them re-see something in their everyday lives, and even how they might see themselves differently as a result of the visit.</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=AFM7A3LN) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">As shown in Figure 1, the left side of the continuum shows the major focus of engagement falling within the content,</mark> [p6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=6&annotation=KBVTDVVD)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">meaning that much of the visitor‚Äôs thoughts, motivations, and emotions are likely to be heavily related to the actual object, artifact, or phenomenon.</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=GV33KBW5) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">At the center of the continuum resides a form of engagement similar to Transformative Experiences (TE) where the individual uses the content to create a new, enhanced understanding of the world. TE involves an expansion of perception, whereby individuals use content as a lens to see and experience the world in meaningful new ways (Pugh et al., 2017).</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=R5BFHFKW) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">TE can be achieved by prompting individuals to relate content to their own everyday experiences and by inviting them to generate literal or metaphorical connections.</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=E4TP2IV8) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-red">Researchers have successfully explored this approach in formal classroom settings and have, through the use of targeted pedagogy, fostered learners‚Äô willingness to connect with content in new ways that increases sustained personal experience with a topic (Pugh et al., 2017,2020 ).</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=GNK7HNPY) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">The right side of the continuum focuses on the self and represents an examination of aspects of one‚Äôs identity including ones‚Äô ideas, experiences, beliefs, and characteristics.</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=5UV5AWZU) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Perceived self-relevance then becomes a first step towards identity exploration ‚Äì when an individual reflects on content in relation to the self it can be used to elicit reexamination of the self in relation to alternative goals, possibilities for action, and roles within various social contexts (Sinai et al., 2012; Kaplan et al., 2014)</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=3W88ZCT7) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">application of the VINES framework as a means of encouraging self-reflection has typically relied on prompts (Garner et al., 2019).</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=EB5WQMWW) 
 
### The present study [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=8QHJ3VGI) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-green">A literature search for eclipse-related research revealed a preponderance of articles on the technical or educational aspects of the eclipse phenomenon situated in formal educational contexts (e.g. Knezek et al., 2017; Vernier, 2017) and little investigation of the ways in which the public might reflect and make personal meaning from such a rare occasion.</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=IUKUFGFU) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">Therefore, one contribution of this study is its deliberate investigation of attendees‚Äô reflections and ideas about the content and self-relevance of a solar eclipse in a naturalistic and unstructured setting where individuals were invited to gather and witness the event.</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=UYM8J92H) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">we posed two research questions: (1) What are visitors‚Äô motivations for attending a public, science-themed solar eclipse event? (2) What engagement is manifest when individuals are prompted by a VINES-based brief intervention?</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=YQXWE84L) 
 
## Method [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=VXYADDJ6) 
 
### Setting [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=9SDYEXXL) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">The study was conducted during an outdoor solar eclipse viewing event held on the campus of a large, public university in the eastern region of the United States.</mark> [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=WC676E5J) 
 
### Prompt development [p7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=7&annotation=QH79SDDG) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">The VINES continuum was used as a framework for developing prompts anchored in the eclipse phenomenon that would solicit ideas about attendance motivation, science content, expansion of perception between the eclipse and life experiences, and metaphorical self-relevance of the eclipse to one‚Äôs life.</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=PCPJZTGH) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">The prompts encouraged responses that could reflect multiple origins of engagement ‚Äì statements about visitors‚Äô motivation to witness the eclipse (prompt 1); statements bridging the use of an idea of being in the right place at the right time with life experiences (prompt 2); statements considering the impact of an eclipse in literal and metaphorical ways (prompt 3); and statements reflecting a self-relevance bridging between the eclipse as a metaphor and a personally meaningful experience(prompt 4).</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=BWNKVTJ4) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">The prompts were:</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=MN8JGSCK) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">Prompt 1. Please tell us why you came to the event today, and what is it about the eclipse that is interesting to you? Prompt 2. People in different places in the world may see no eclipse, a partial eclipse, or a full eclipse. Some travel far to see a total eclipse. Seeing a total eclipse is like being in the right place at the right time. How can you use this idea of an eclipse as an analogy to something in your own life? Please explain. Prompt 3. During the total solar eclipse, the temperature is expected to drop 10‚Äì15 degrees Fahrenheit. What does this tell you about the sun‚Äôs rays? What are the sun‚Äôs rays exactly? What in your everyday life is like the sun‚Äôs rays? Please explain. Prompt 4. A solar eclipse takes place when the Moon temporarily moves between the Sun and Earth. This event briefly allows us to see objects in our solar system differently. How might an eclipse, or the idea of an eclipse, relate to your life? Be creative and think of any connection that is meaningful to you.</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=3UWIKW62) 
 
### Participants and procedure [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=47S5UN2S) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">More than 2,000 people attended the event, which took place in a large open area on an urban university campus.</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=476L9LA2) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">Approximately 100 adult individuals were approached to participate in the study and 85 agreed to do so. Attendees were approached at random by one of two authors during a two-hour period on the day of the eclipse.</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=UF2NS5RP) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">After a brief consent statement, and if they agreed to participate, attendees were provided with the prompts in the form of a one-page document. Participation required 5‚Äì10 min per person and almost all (90%) responses were collected prior to the onset of the total solar eclipse.</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=TYVYLP6R) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">The final data set consisted of responses from 79 adult participants. Participants‚Äô ages ranged from 18 to 76 years, with 41% falling in the 18‚Äì29 age range. A majority (60%) of respondents were female, 35% were male, and 5% of participants did not specify their gender.</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=VZNLTFUH) 
 
### Data analysis [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=87NXANJY) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">Responses were imported into NVivo qualitative analysis software and coded by prompt at the sentence level.</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=L2MLFY62) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">The analysis was approached in this way to preserve the richness of the responses and uncover the ways in which multiple forms of engagement manifested within the same response.</mark> [p8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=8&annotation=8TKE4WLF) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">For the second research question, which sought to investigate how the prompt questions solicited content, content-and-world, and self-based responses, authors conducted two phases of data analysis</mark> [p9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=9&annotation=NQYMUEPZ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">In the first phase, data were analysed inductively and thematically to identify common responses to each question. This provided an overall impression about the focus of the respondents‚Äô engagement while answering a particular question. In the second phase, the VINES model was used in a deductive manner to inform the coding scheme.</mark> [p9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=9&annotation=V5VC826R) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">Expansion of perception-focused responses were operationalized as being able to connect the idea of the eclipse to an everyday concept in either a concrete or a metaphorical fashion.</mark> [p9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=9&annotation=MPDA2QVN) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">Self-relevance focused responses were operationalized as referring to personal qualities and characteristics or autobiographical life events.</mark> [p9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=9&annotation=F7K795HQ)

- <mark class="hltr-gray">When science content was explained and then connected to the respondent‚Äôs specific life experiences, it was coded as a co-occurrence of content and perceived self-relevance.</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=HXCYXF88) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">When participants not only connected the eclipse to an everyday concept but also related the concept to themselves and their own specific life experiences, the response was coded as a co-occurrence of expansion of perception and perceived self-relevance.</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=G4S6YWZF) 
 
## Results [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=N6Q9L2HG) 
 
### Research Question 1. What are visitors‚Äô motivations for attending a public, sciencethemed solar eclipse event? [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=K9FGCYT4) 
 
#### Types of anticipated experiences [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=KC3CKEX9) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">When prompted to describe the reason for attending the eclipse viewing event, 68 (86%) of the participants indicated anticipation of one or more types of experiences (Pekarik et al., 1999; see Table 1).</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=JXH48CXY) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Most of these respondents (n = 62, 91%) sought an Object/Phenomenon experience, meaning they emphasized witnessing the eclipse with or without additional purposes. Of these individuals, about one third (n = 23, 37%) also explicitly mentioned the rarity of the event.</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=VIBXBG54) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">small number of responses (n = 6, 9%) did not make reference to anticipating an Object/Phenomenon experience. Of these, three responses were coded as anticipating a Social Experience (e.g. ‚ÄòTo spend time with like-minded science interested individuals‚Äô), two responses were coded as anticipating an Introspective Experience (e.g. ‚ÄòMemories ‚Äì third grade‚Äô), and one response was coded as anticipating a Cognitive experience (e.g. ‚ÄòI came because I thought it was educational‚Äô)</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=PUKW59DY) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Notably, about one quarter (n = 19, 28%) of these responses revealed expectations for two or more kinds of experiences.</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=3G3LTNZI) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Most (n = 12, 63%) of this group anticipated an Object/Phenomenon experience and a Social experience; as one participant commented:</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=V8SPP35K) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Three responses referenced an Object/Phenomenon experience plus an Introspective experience. One respondent shared,</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=FZLBIBRL) 
 
#### Anticipated experiences [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=GIFTIB8Q) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Using Falk‚Äôs motivation-based identity framework, 75 (95%) participants produced responses to prompt 1 that could be classified into one or more categories that Falk et al. designated as visitor identities, which reveal anticipatory purposes for engagement (see Table 2).</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=IGASLPVF) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Of these, 57 (76%) revealed a single motivation type and remaining responses expressed multiple purposes.</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=27XPAUJ6) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Many (n = 51, 68%) of the responses were categorized as Experience Seekers, which focus on attending the event because of its perceived importance.</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=FH8AGTN4) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Multiple respondents also shared that they were a Facilitator of others‚Äô experiences (n = 20, 27%).</mark> [p10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=10&annotation=B4JVQ7YM) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Perhaps unsurprisingly given the community setting and large group event format, none of the respondents provided attendance motivation consistent with Falk‚Äôs categories of Respectful Pilgrims and Rechargers.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=6FM8BUWS) 
 
#### Visitors‚Äô attendance motivation [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=BZMKZ6HM) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">When the two coding frameworks were combined, we found that most (n = 70, 87%) participants revealed at least one purpose and one anticipated experience in their responses. The most frequent combination was the Experience Seeker purpose with the Object/Phenomenon anticipated experience, which accounted for 39% of responses.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=MVE56FEX) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Another relatively frequent combination was the Facilitator-Object/Phenomenon anticipated experience, which was identified among 23% of participants who expressed motivations for attending based on a desire to share the experience and knowledge with family and friends.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=PWEH9MWG) 
 
### Research Question 2: what engagement is manifest when individuals are prompted by a VINES-based brief intervention? [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=45F8VTQP) 
 
#### Responses about science content [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=VL535NXE) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Sixty-two participants (78%) produced 98 distinct content-focused statements.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=LZUKMIPD) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">The third prompt, which encouraged participants to relay content about the sun as a component of the eclipse phenomenon, produced most (72%) of the content-focused responses.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=6VN23N5I) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Some participants (n = 37) identified that the sun‚Äôs rays generate heat and described them as energy and light.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=BK96MK2A) 
 
#### Responses indicating an expansion of perception [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=B4TCJLR5) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Over three-quarters (n = 61, 77%) of participants produced 99 responses across prompts 2, 3 and 4 that related ideas about the eclipse and associated science concepts to an aspect of their everyday life experiences (Pugh et al., 2017; Bell et al., 2009; Rounds, 1999).</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=FB6KATTG) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Responses related to the eclipse in both literal and metaphorical ways to either a scientific or human aspect of the world.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=AWJEEJCB) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">One-third (33%) of the comments reflecting connections between the eclipse phenomena and the everyday world referred to science concepts like radiant heat energy or the impact of electromagnetic radiation on the earth.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=AZMNPFJJ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Although not indicative of a transformative experience per se, these responses illustrate one of its components ‚Äì expanded perception.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=WSBMGL5A) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Statements relating the eclipse to human experiences made up the remaining two-thirds (67%) of these responses, a vast majority (98%) of which were in response to prompts 2 and 4.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=QADFEKNQ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Most were metaphorical and focused on the significance of being in the right place at the right time, having experiences that cause a shift in one‚Äôs perspective, or experiencing transitory periods of loneliness or sadness.</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=IARK5EN6) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Responses to the second prompt used the idea of being in the right place at the right time to explain, in general terms, life experiences like falling in love (n = 3) or being exposed to professional opportunities (n = 3).</mark> [p11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=11&annotation=6P7PA24B) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Within this group, some wrote in general terms about the importance of seizing opportunity in a transitory moment, while others wrote in general terms about the importance of living in the moment.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=U9JSEJ9N) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Multiple responses to prompt 4 used the idea of the moon passing in front of the sun to focus on experiences that cause a perspective shift (n = 11).</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=VG5MYCUJ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">One participant highlighted this when they wrote, ‚ÄòWhen an unusual event occurs, it can cause many people to see things in a different light. Give people a new perspective.‚Äô</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=LY4GPIJS) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Others used the idea of darkness created by an eclipse to reflect on human emotions and life experiences (n = 7).</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=U4HC2YSU) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">There will be periods of darkness in all of our lives.‚Äô Additionally, seven participants related the eclipse to obstacles in life that must be overcome.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=QY5KCLE8) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Several responses indicating an expansion of perception connected science content to the human experience.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=846E3PR7) 
 
#### Responses reflecting self-relevance [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=JXG4MQA4) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Sixty-five participants (82%) wrote 88 comments in which they reflected on their own personal beliefs, attitudes, and experiences (Kaplan et al., 2014; Bell et al., 2009; Rahm, 2012).</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=ZXVSU9VG) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Although instances of perceived self-relevance occurred in response to each survey prompt, the first prompt about motivations for attending the event produced the greatest volume (55%) of self-focused statements.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=5356878S) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Personal relevance was often described in relation to a social role;</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=Z5LDZ8A7) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Some participants shared that they attended because they had a personal interest in science or astronomy (n = 12), whereas others connected to the rarity of the event to convey personal insights about themselves and their experiences.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=4WNIU47K) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">A smaller proportion of the responses (12%) applied the eclipse analogy in prompt 2 to express self-relevance.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=CAC86L4U) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Common responses focused on meaningful experiences that arose from being in the right place at the right time (n = 6).</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=9WNAPUCI) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">When asked to describe what in their daily life is like the sun‚Äôs rays, 17% of the responses were personal statements connecting the phenomenon to participants‚Äô own lived experiences.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=HGJBAPQB) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Multiple individuals compared the sun‚Äôs rays to their feelings towards loved ones (n = 4).</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=K8FNNVWV) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Remaining statements of self-relevance (16%) were in response to prompt 4 and connected ideas about the eclipse to participants‚Äô lives.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=XZHU6BI5) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Some participants (n = 5) applied the idea to disclose instances where their viewpoint changed. Others related to the concept of darkness to explain their own challenges or ideas (n = 3).</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=Z4JJ5SFT) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Additional reflections compared personal instances of life-changing events to an eclipse, like losing a loved one, or compared the eclipse to personal experiences that were temporary.</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=2MWV7SYU) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Prompts focusing on science content produced few self-relevance references (see Figure 2).</mark> [p12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=12&annotation=6U7K94LQ) 
 
#### Responses revealing co-occurrent engagement foci [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=XSMZY3VW) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">The third prompt yielded the greatest volume of responses that suggested multiple engagement foci.</mark> [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=9CEJVKSS) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">coded as content and expansion of perception). Other responses drew metaphorical parallels such as,</mark> [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=3EXAKVS7) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">One fifth of the participants (n = 18; 23%) provided statements in which expansion of perception and perceived self-relevance co-occurred.</mark> [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=6JVS2V7A) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Overall, varied and deep forms of engagement were manifest in responses to the prompts.</mark> [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=IJPHT2CZ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">he number of responses categorized according to content, expansion of perception, and self-relevance is included in Figure 2.</mark> [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=UNUAUEN8) 
 
## Discussion [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=JINKJWKA) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-gray">Our goals included understanding purposes for attending and the types of anticipated experiences that visitors brought to the event, and examining whether attendees‚Äô thinking and reflecting about the phenomenon could, if prompted, include its application to the world and its personal meaning.</mark> [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=74BVJ2G9) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Purposes for attending and anticipated experiences were diverse in nature but thematically tied to the phenomenon rather than to the location of the event ‚Äì a likely feature of the uniqueness, time-specificity, and publicity surrounding the solar eclipse.</mark> [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=2VNKQ2X3) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Frequently, individuals referred to Figure 2. Participant engagement responses by prompt. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION, PART B 1</mark> [p13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=13&annotation=L9TDSR7M) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">both the personal significance of the eclipse and their desire to share it with family members and friends.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=84IHS8NL) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-red">This finding reflects an alignment between Falk‚Äôs(2009) conceptualization of categories for di fferent purposes for engagement by museum visitors, and Pekarik‚Äôs (Pekarik et al.,1999) classifications of visitors‚Äô preferences for satisfying museum visits.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=WHHLM9VL) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">The intersection of personal, social and content within an engagement experience is reminiscent of research in formal educational settings that has examined individuals‚Äô phenomenological experiences of self-relevance.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=XCJPF33Y) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">in their recent study, Hartwell and Kaplan (2018) found that Junior High School students‚Äô construction of self-relevance for science topics included three distinct dimensions or points of origin: the content; a bridge or relation between the academic content and the concept of self; and the student‚Äô beliefs, goals, interests, values, and other personal characteristics.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=CQF87P2A) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">The authors proposed that it is important for educators and researchers to keep a multidimensional conceptualization of self-relevance in mind, as it allows for a deeper understanding of the learner ‚Äì or, in this case, the attendee ‚Äì and opportunities to leverage the various reasons why the topic is of significance in order to promote an enhanced experience.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=3WTKI74X) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Initial purposes for attending and the major categories of anticipated experiences did not seem to limit literal and metaphorical thinking and reflection about the scientific phenomenon at hand.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=QIJFWPR9) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">three-fourths of the respondents then went on to write responses that indicated an expansion of perception, where they transferred the literal or metaphorical concept of the eclipse to their everyday lives, and four-fifths wrote one or more statements detailing the significant personal relevance of the eclipse.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=DM9XWVB9) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">even attendees who primarily anticipated a content-focused experience engaged with the science content in a contemplative way when prompted.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=9BZZ2CIV) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">supports both the potential utility of the brief intervention strategy used in this study, and provides an empirical example of the fluid continuum of engagement described in the VINES model that ranges from visitors‚Äô focus on the content to a focus on personal relevance and eventually, to the self as the subject of reflection.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=AXF3ED7Y) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">It also suggests that event organizers and museum educators need not necessarily rely on visitors‚Äô initial statements about the purpose of their visit as the sole anchor from which to prompt meaning making.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=2G4S37W2) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">The social context of the eclipse viewing event was of primary interest to one in four respondents.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=MBH4JKA4) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">his highlights the salience of social and familial roles at public science events, and particularly the roles of parents and grandparents.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=TYJWGUMZ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">The intersection of these ideas ‚Äì social context, family member social role, and a rare event ‚Äì is intriguing, as it potentially offers both benefits and challenges for capturing and promoting attendees‚Äô resulting impressions about a collective experience of science.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=JQJIM767) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">This particular event, and perhaps the scaffold of the prompts, created a context that increased the salience of both the content and the intertwined personal-social experience.</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=LZIJPB5N) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">In this way, the context of a public science-themed event might serve as a bridge between content and self-relevance, and promote new ways of thinking about content and the world do not necessarily require explicit modeling as has been more common in formal educational settings in which transformative experiences have been studied (</mark> [p14](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=14&annotation=JEKJUAZ9) 
 
### Implications [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=NZCP3B2R) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">This study demonstrates how a brief, prompt-based activity provided a vehicle for event attendees to articulate multiple forms of engagement during a single point in time, regardless of their original attendance motivation</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=XZ6CUQ87) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">It is supportive of the utility of the VINES model as a framework for thinking about ways to capture various types of engagement and the ways in which engagement might shift in response to a prompt posed by an informal educator, exhibition text, or interactive response platform.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=G5SE4X73) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Although many science events focus on increasing the public‚Äôs content knowledge, our study suggests that audiences may respond to strategies that invite connections between science content and lived experiences.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=S6T4DT56) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">The findings offer entities that provide unstructured or single-attendance events the possibility that visitors‚Äô thinking can be supported without placing a high time burden on the visitor or a high cost burden on the host.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=6ZQWBQVW) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">uture research might explore the interplay among phenomena-oriented interest and other forms of engagement for diverse groups of visitors. Such information might be useful for those seeking to design interactive portions of events that can reach broad, diverse audiences.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=RXT7QXRG) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">It may offer options to capture the thinking of visitors who are presented with conceptual information through signage or other advance organizers (Falk & Storksdieck, 2005).</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=PWJD3E9K) 
 
### Limitations [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=BY8ZWN8E) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Responses were completed in an unstructured and busy environment, and individuals may have been distracted by either the presence of others in the immediate vicinity, or by the spectacle of the event that was shortly going to unfold around them.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=TLJICJMN) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">The setting also meant that researchers were unable to interact with attendees for a prolonged period of time, which limited the amount of information that could be gathered.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=WCTWZLIQ) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">The unstructured nature of the event also lent itself to the use of a convenience sample, which limits the generalizability of the study to other contexts and groups of attendees.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=32EUXUNS) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Participants‚Äô responses were to multi-part prompts, which yielded rich and diverse statements but also limited our ability to draw direct and unequivocal connections between particular components of a prompt and its corresponding response.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=WKEARGNL) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">In addition, due to the limited time and our focus on visitors‚Äô meaning making about the eclipse, we chose not to assess visitors‚Äô understanding of eclipse concepts. This decision means that the study cannot draw conclusions about the relation between prior knowledge about eclipses, and particular types of meaning making.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=MRDM9REN) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Finally, it is important to note that the design of this study was not experimental or of a pretest/ posttest design, which limits the scope of any conclusions that can be drawn regarding the nature of attendees‚Äô engagement in the absence of the prompts and the effect that witnessing the eclipse may have had on responses.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=49N5MG7W) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Although the transformative and self-relevant engagement manifest in responses was likely influenced by the VINES-based intervention, we cannot infer a causal relationship.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=B6UBV6MH) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Future research might address these shortcomings through experimental research or by implementing an exit or post-phenomenon prompt, as this would allow researchers to identify attendees‚Äô concluding thoughts and any shifts in their thinking that took place during the event.</mark> [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=TLGRPZTD) 
 
## Conclusion [p15](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=15&annotation=BMUI86IP) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">Many adults who participate in these events may not have sufficient time, prior knowledge, or interest to invest in learning new information.</mark> [p16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=16&annotation=XK9QRXPD) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-orange">However, the current study suggests that many adults may be willing to take a few moments to think about the science content that lies at the heart of the event, and that brief prompts can support meaning making and content- and self-relevant engagement.</mark> [p16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=16&annotation=6V7X6XE6) 
 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">Further research is needed to examine the degree to which the foci of visitors‚Äô engagement supports learning and attitudinal outcomes, so that public science events can be used as an opportunity for attendees to reflect on content, the contexts in which they encounter it, and their own role and sphere of influence on the world.</mark> [p16](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GMUYU2AW?page=16&annotation=RDNIJNLR)
