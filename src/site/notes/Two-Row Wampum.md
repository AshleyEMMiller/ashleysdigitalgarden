# History
The Two-Row Wampum woven belt was a treaty between two nations or groups of people. It is a belt made of beads and shells of two colours: white and blue/purple. 

The White represents the river of life. 

The purple represents the people. 

The two purple bars of the wampum belt do not intersect, but coexist side by side. It represents an agreement of people who live and work alongside each other in non-interference (not crossing over). The emphasis is on respecting each peoples' autonomy. 

# Indigenous and Western Science Framework
Two-eyed seeing is one of several [[Indigenous Philosophies\|Indigenous Philosophies]] that can be used to create a dialogue between [[Indigenous Science\|Indigenous Science]] and [[Western Science\|Western Science]]. However, [[02. Notes/Notes/Two-Eyed Seeing\|Two-Eyed Seeing]] is about integration and is a [[Mi'kmaw\|Mi'kmaw]] concept. Other Indigenous nations may have more culturally relevant conceptions. 

For the Mowhawk people of Anusheanabe the Two-Row Wampum is a more relevant way of viewing [[Western scienence\|western]] and [[Indigenous Science\|Indigenous Science]]. They can coexist side by side but they do not need to integrate.
